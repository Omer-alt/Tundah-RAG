The study was based on the Symbolic Interactionism (SI) theory of Social Psychology and adopted the use of narrative qualitative research methods. The study facilitated the gathering of data of narratives related to culture and the rituals with regard to the marriage of the Abagusii ethnic community. The qualitative study used a focus group of 12 elderly people from the Gusii community who were selected through purposeful and snowball sampling. Research instruments included interview schedules, the data was then analysed using qualitative within the purview of the research questions and the marriage rites themes. Focus group discussions were used to identify issues and interpretations. A discussion guide was used to ask general questions. The qualitative study findings indicated that various Kisii traditional marriage rites were practised to sustain marital stability. These include initiation and mentorship into adulthood, courtship, aided partner search, in-*laws' visitations,*  introduction ceremonies, payment of bridal wealth, wrestling matches, weddings and post-wedding marriage rituals. Finally, the qualitative study found out that traditional marriage rites are believed to circumvent divorce and contribute to marital stability.   Marriage sustainability was through celebrations and communal support. The study recommends that there is a need to revive the African traditional marriage practices and marriage therapists can incorporate this perspective during marital counselling sessions.  Keywords: Marriage, marriage rites, marital stability, bridal wealth  ## Background  Marital instability has increased tremendously in western developed countries since the mid-1960s. Despite the lack of consistent data, it seems that the same   Association for the Promotion of African Studies trend has been noted in Iran recently (Vakili et al 2015). Marital instability reveals affective and cognitive states in the company, with related actions, which are foreseen to terminate a relationship (Kreager et al 2014). Meyer Fortes purports that many first unions may be terminated after some time. To capture the flexible character of these marriages Fortes classifies them as 'experimental marriages' (Fortes1949).  Kihombo (2018) asserts that in spite the marital conflicts being a worldwide phenomenon, the United States is the leading country in the world in terms of marital conflicts that lead to divorces. Existing research suggests that different types of violence often coexist: physical IPV is often accompanied by sexual IPV, and is usually accompanied by emotional abuse. For example, in the WHO multi-country study, 23\u201356% of women who reported ever experiencing physical or sexual IPV had experienced both (3). A comparative analysis of DHS data from 12 Latin American and Caribbean countries found that the majority (61\u201393%) of women who reported physical IPV in the past 12 months also reported experiencing emotional abuse  (Bott S. et al. 2012). A study was conducted on how individual characteristics, family backgrounds, homogamous/heterogamous marriages, and dyadic interactions are linked with marital conflict and marital satisfaction among married Chinese participants. Multivariate statistical analyses based on the China General Social Survey 2006 data (CGSS 2006) indicate that marital duration, rural origin, egalitarian decision-making, and frequent dyadic communication decrease marital conflict, whereas personal income, egalitarian gender ideologies, social class standing, and double-earner status elevate marital conflict (Xiaohe Xu and Donna Miller 2017).  Karimi et al (2019) explain that the extracted protective factors associated with marital stability in long-term marriage were classified as interpersonal and intrapersonal. It remains unclear exactly what role culture plays in race-ethnic differences in marital behaviour. Accounting for the traditional culture among Mexican Americans does not explain the earlier age at marriage for Mexican Americans as compared to Whites (Raley et al., 2004). However, Raley et al. (2004) suggest that culture may be significant to ethnic differences in marriage patterns and emphasize the need for future research to focus on specific aspects of culture. We examine several cultural factors, including social support, religion, and attitudes about marriage and gender. According to Kihombo (2018)   Association for the Promotion of African Studies socialization is one of the factors that are responsible for marriage divorce in Africa and around the globe generally.  Recent evidence has shown that Africa has witnessed a high rate of marital conflict as a result of westernization, globalization, urbanization and industrialization periods triggered by a monetary industrial economy that have affected the extended families that had the responsibility to solve any conflict between the couples (Adeniran, 2015). According to Vida (2013), available 7 information, on Sub-Saharan Africa including Tanzania has depicted an increasing rate of marriage breakdowns, even though statistics on marriage breakdowns in the region are limited and unreliable. This is due to some studies conducted in the area of marital dissolution and the little coverage on registration of marriages and divorces. Though limited, the UN (2006) as cited in Vida (2013) has indicated that more than one-third of women in this region experience marital dissolution before they reach ages forty and sixty in their first marriages.   A study conducted on South African people in rural KwaZulu-Natal between 2000 and 2006 on marriages, focused on the distribution of marital status by age and sex, purports that some adults are reported as divorced or separated, the proportion not rising above five per cent in any age group. The low rate of divorce in The Africa Centre Demographic Information System (ACDIS) population likely reflects the high proportion of marriages contracted through customary rites. Prior to 1998, marriages contracted under the Customary Marriage Act could be dissolved by a tribal court. However, in reality, this was rarely done given the complexity of the marriage process and attendant payments between families, barriers to litigation by women, and traditional customs that allowed men to take additional wives. A large number of couples continue to embark upon the process of \"ilobolo\" or become engaged, going on to marry in both traditional and civil ceremonies. There could also be underreporting of divorce, particularly in families whose faith tradition does not permit divorce (Hosegood et al 2006).   Marital instability is an emerging and increasing phenomenon in Kenyan societies. A study by (Musau et al 2015) examined, the nature of marital instability among women in the rural areas, the major causes, and its impact on the female-headed household livelihoods. The study adopted a cross-sectional case study design and it involved women of the 15-49 age interval years who were separated, divorced or deserted by their husbands. Most of the separated   Association for the Promotion of African Studies mothers are faced with challenges of achieving and maintaining their livelihood due to financial hardships. Okeno (2012) conducted research in Kenya among the Abagusii community which assessed the influence of Christianity on Kisii traditional marriage with particular reference to bridewealth in Gucha District, Kisii county Kenya. The church on the same note will be able to adopt important aspects from the traditional view of bridewealth of the Abagusii purposely to enrich the payment of bride price in the Christian church.

        "sentence_chunk": "found out that both Christian and traditional marriages agree in one way or another. Both share a system of 'bridewealth negotiation, the ceremonies binding the payment of bridewealth, which assists in countering divorce. Further, the respondents on variables agreed that both bride price systems are interlinked. The study, therefore, recommended that there should be a common system of bridewealth in both Christian and traditional marriages and a common form of bridewealth negotiation and terms of payment among all groups.   In the past, most studies have been conducted worldwide but few studies have been carried out in Africa. More so, other studies have been focusing on other factors that contribute to marital but few studies have focused on culture and especially the contribution of the African traditions on marital stability. Hardly any studies have specifically focused on the role of marriage rites in marital stability within the Abagusii community.  ## Methods  The study was conducted in Kisii and Nyamira counties by the members of the Abagusii community. The use of qualitative methods for this study was to facilitate the gathering of narratives and lived experiences related to culture and the rituals of the Abagusii, and more so, with regard to and as manifested in marriage. The use of qualitative methods for this study facilitated the gathering of data of narratives related to culture and the rituals with regard to the marriage of the Abagusii ethnic community. The qualitative study used a focus group of 12 elderly people as a representative group of the Gusii community who were selected through purposeful and snowball sampling. Research instruments included interview schedules, the data was then analysed using qualitative design within the purview of the research questions and the marriage rites themes. Focus group discussions were used to identify issues and interpretations. A discussion guide was used to ask general questions. Results Association for the Promotion of African Studies Questions that were used in facilitating the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)  were drawn from the interview guide prepared for the study. The principal aim of these discussions was to explore the marriage rites practised by the Abagusii people and examine the influence of marriage rites on marital stability. The thematic analysis resulted in the exhaustive descriptions of Kisii Marriage rites and the effects on marital stability. The responses from the participants were recorded in video and field notes were captured. Thereafter, the results were coded and significant statements formed at aided in generating categories and themes from the focus group discussions.  ![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)  Association for the Promotion of African Studies Fig 1 Themes on which marriage rites are significant The African Traditional Marriage Rites Practised by the Abagusii People Initiation and Adulthood The participants reported that one of these customs is the initiation rite. This entailed circumcision and receiving various teachings on the transition into adulthood. Among the Abagusii, no one could get into marriage without being initiated by circumcision. Since marriage was thought of as the most important thing it was believed to be the beginning of life. The bearing of children was regarded as the fruit of marriage. Marriage among the Abagusii is intrinsically connected to initiation. Interviews showed that it was widely believed that circumcision reduces sexual urges in women and would sustain a marriage. In continuing with the practice, the Kisii seek to ensure that their women do not become promiscuous.   The participant emphasized that the circumcision exercise was highly regarded and more rituals were performed and vow taken that would help in sustaining their marriages later in life. The study established that upholding cultural traditions were the main reason why initiation was practised. Female circumcision was considered an integral part of the Kisii people's way of life and culture as the study found out during the interview. As one respondent pointed out,  \"Boys and girls were circumcised at puberty which symbolised endurance and a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood. Preserving sexual morality was a reason given why female circumcision was undertaken. Circumcision was also important for men since after circumcision they join adulthood and take new roles in the community like fending for the family, offering defence during tribal war and attack from wild animals and cattle rustlers.\" (Participant 2, focus group discussion, March 2022) According to Mayer (1953), both boys and girls went through marital counselling on what was expected of them in transition into adulthood and how to handle their relationships once they got married. The pain that they underwent during circumcision without sedation was to train and prepare them to learn to endure as they transit into adulthood. One of the participants had a view that; Association for the Promotion of African Studies \"They were taught various traditions and how to step into adulthood.   They were taught about sexuality, adult roles, hard work, protection and fending for the family among other roles. They underwent marriage counselling from aunts and uncles, on a commitment to marriage by being faithful, in order to escape curses and harsh punishment including death that resulted from breaking the marital taboos \"amasangi\". (Participant 1, focus group discussion, March 2022)  ## Courtship  The participants reported that the courtship period did not last for a long time because they entirely depended on the information gathered from the gobetween (esigani) This is the time between bride and groom identification and wedding. During this short period, the two main steps entailed partner search and groom and also bride identification and introductions (ekerorano). There were certain rituals that were practised including visitations, introductions, feasting, further spying and investigations of the two families.  A go-between (*esigani*) would be identified by the parents of the boy. The gobetween (*esigani)* may be of either gender and maybe a neighbour or a relative.  He or she is sent by the boy's parents to assist in searching for a suitable girl for marriage. A go-between who could be a distant relative or friend was sent to identify a good, hardworking girl with a good sexual reputation (not sexually promiscuous), not short-tempered and whose parents are not witches (*abarogi*). The go-between is to first give a detailed report to both sides  (*ogosigana*); this was his first task. (Nyaruri, 2014). The final task of the gobetween was to find out whether the girl has any disfiguring marks on her body which are not visible when dressed, that is, beauty and health check. (Okeno, D.   2012). One of the respondents pointed out that; \"Emissaries and spying and mediation \"Esigani\" could try to inquire about bridal virginity test, \"ogwekunga\" and grooms' sexual ability assessments. They checked if the families were witches or thieves or if it was a lazy girl or if they had scars on their body. The existence of such scars particularly those resulting from burns was sometimes seen as parenting carelessness or lower the bride price.\" (Participant 4, focus group discussion, March 2022) In-laws visitations and introduction ceremonies (Ekerorano) were done where a feast that was called 'Ekeri- *boko'* (eating and drinking with in-laws). Usually, this  Association for the Promotion of African Studies was done in the evening followed by much dancing, drinking and festivity. A  goat and some chicken were slaughtered and served. The participants narrated that, \"The visitors felt more honoured with the goat meat due to its bigger size as compared to chicken. It was taboo for the groom to eat chicken at the in-laws since due to its smaller size, it's believed to be like despise or disrespect to the son-in-law. However again when the chicken was served, it was a test conducted to see if the groom is trained to abhor traditions and taboos since in case, he ate, then the in-law's relationship  (oboko) may be",

        "sentence_chunk": "broken. (Participant 8, focus group discussion, March 2022)  ## Bride Wealth  Payment of bride price involves the two groups of elders thatl meet at the groom's home for bride price negotiations known as *\"okomanachiombe*\" (scrutiny and selection of cattle) which constituted the first important step in the bride price transfer. A participant explained that; \"More animals were given as bride price for girls that were virgins and sometimes if not, the girls were sent back to be married later as second wives. The girl had to report privately to the aunts later if the man was competent in sexuality. Bride price payment was always accompanied by eating and bride price was paid the bride price in instalments for the two families to ensure that they keep standards for the marriage not to break and for bride price debt to be eventually cleared.\" (Participant 7, focus group discussion, March 2022) In the process of selection, the alders portrayed a business-like spirit of hard bargaining and arguments between the giving elders and the receiving elders. If the animals offered at the view were accepted, the bride's father declared his final satisfaction. He could not afterwards ask for more. This means that if he was not satisfied with the offered bride's wealth, he rejected the proposal there and then. The element of finality in the agreement was outwardly symbolized by an intensive celebration which took place immediately after acceptance (Obegi, 1920).   Association for the Promotion of African Studies Post bride price bride's new home pre-visit entailed a test after the bride's arrival on the sexual performance of both the bride and the groom. This was a handle that led to a big trial for the two because the impotence of the groom would cause the bride to break off the marriage. A girl could also be sent away!  \"The bride was supposed to be taken to her new home a few days later after bride price payment for orientation. Once she arrived at the groom's home, she was welcomed with lots of feasting and celebrations.\" (Participant 3, focus group discussion, March 2022)  ## Wedding Ceremonies And Rituals  A wrestling match (\"enyameni) and the bridegroom's final visit was organized between the men of the girl's party and the groom's men. The *obokano* (harp) is the main musical instrument of the Abagusii people and was played. The wrestling winning team was given a bull for slaughter. The focus group discussion panellists reported that; \"After the prewedding feasts, the bridegroom visits the bride home some days later smartly dressed and highly decorated with, skin wristband  (ebitwanga), anklets (chinchigiri) and a crown on his head (ekiore and on the following day the two groups meet for a wrestling match \"enyameni\" and the winning team takes home a whole slaughtered bull.\". (Participant 5, focus group discussion, March 2022) A prewedding ceremony \"ekeragerio\" precedes the real wedding day and it's a big celebration that is organised at the groom's and brides' homes but on different days. The bride will have gone back to her home to participate in the prewedding ceremony. On this day, a bull is slaughtered and the main aim is to just make merry and give speeches and advice to the bride or groom. The wedding (enyangi) itself was performed by the wedding officiant who acted as a priest, '*omokundekane*' to join the couple.  \"Somewhere in the middle of the way, the group of relatives and villagers from the girl home met the other group of bridegrooms' sides and handed over their daughter and went back. When the party reached the boy's home, more rituals are performed\" (Participant 11, focus group discussion, March 2022).  Association for the Promotion of African Studies The wedding symbols (ebitwanga, ebitinge,ebete) where the newly wedded were marked by putting on some bracelets and anklets or even rings to show that they are married and they could only be removed in case of death or divorce.  ## Post-Wedding Rituals  After the wedding, it meant that the relationship had been cemented. The parent's in-law from the two groups would start calling each other by a special and respectable name, that is, \"the nurturer\" (korera). The bride and groom also started referring to the parents' in-laws as their own parents, that is, mum and dad (mama and tata). The bridal homecoming feast (kwarigania *omoriakari)* was very significant.  The meal-sharing \"ugali\" feast was performed where ugali, '*obokima*' is brought with a ready slaughtered goat meat from the bride's home by her sisters, cousins and girlfriends (young maidens carrying on their heads) a few days after the main wedding or customary marriage rites. The main agenda of the visitation was for the young maidens to find out about the welfare of their sister and confirm if their sister arrived safely on the wedding day and if she was being treated well. (Participant 6, focus group discussion, March 2022) \"Within the first week after the bride has come to the bridegroom's home, 'obokima' ugali in a nicely made basket and raw meat is brought by women from the bride's home. The reason for this is to check how their daughter arrived and how she was welcomed. They also took this opportunity to inquire about her husband's 'fitness'. This bringing of ugali and slaughtered goat could be done again later on two or more occasions.\" Newborn celebrations *\"Ekerero*\" were highly regarded if the couple has a child, after a year or so, several rites are performed, beer and food are brought from the girl's home. The boy's home also slaughters a goat and prepares a feast to welcome the newborn. The villager could also offer to work for the new mum and bring various gifts to celebrate the newborn. This occasion is called 'o*gwasimoria omwana*', calling the child by name. (Participant 12, focus group discussion, March 2022)  Association for the Promotion of African Studies \"Newborns were highly celebrated; there were other marital ceremonies that were carried out all along throughout the lifetime of the married couples to ensure the sustainability of the marriage\" If the married couples live together for about two years without offspring, people begin to suspect both of them. In most cases, the parents of the boy contact some magicians and traditional healers to treat or to give guidance or advice on the steps to be taken. On the other hand, a close relation of the groom may be identified and then asked to come privately relate sexually with the bride. If it is the man's fault, the girl is allowed to stay and somebody takes the opportunity to give birth with her and the offspring were counted to belong to the wedded husband. However, if the woman is at fault, the man has full responsibility to divorce her!  ## Discussions  The analysis supposes the Symbolic interactionists theory that explores the changing meanings attached to family. They argue that shared activities help to build emotional bonds among family members, and that marriage and family relationships are based on negotiated meanings. The interactionist perspective emphasizes that families reinforce and rejuvenate bonds through symbolic mechanism rituals such as family meals and holidays. Marriage breakdown is rare for those who practice traditional marriage rites. According to Musau (2015), Kenya is still faced with the problem of an increase in marital instabilities and there is little information available about the causes of this trend, its effect on the family institution and the effectiveness and appropriateness of the existing policies and programmes in curbing the problem. The research participants also noted that of late, very many marriages are breaking. Yakubu (1998) opined that in marriage, there are lots of stresses, bitterness, failures and successes. Other factors that threaten marital stability include the age of marriage, educational level of spouse, religion, income, type of marriage, fertility status, kind of family background of spouses, communication, culture, etc. The results indicate that since marriage was thought of as the most important thing it was believed to be the beginning of life. The bearing of children was regarded as the fruit",

        "sentence_chunk": "of marriage. The most significant finding was that marriage was a community affair and it could only be strengthened through participation in various marriage rites. In   Association for the Promotion of African Studies line with the expected results, the Kisii community actively engaged in various marriage ceremonies just like all other African communities. This is in line with marriage is a major transforming ceremony in African Religion. It is viewed as a community activity that involves all members, those who are currently physically living in the community, the ancestors and those yet to be born. This point comes out clearly in Mbiti's explanation of the nature of Bahemuka, (1992). The study established that upholding cultural traditions were the main reason why initiation was practised. The participants reported that respect for culture was highly regarded among the Abagusii people, especially in matters of marriage relationships. Contrary to this, within the Americans, the most prominent aspects of couples' relationships linked to marital stability consisted of religion, sexual relationship, commitment, intimacy, and congruence in values and beliefs. In Asian countries, the most prominent factors included communication, religion, children, conflict resolution, emotional issues and love, and in European countries, the key factors included a sexual relationship, commitment, relationship satisfaction, and support from one's mate (Karimi et al 2019). Female circumcision was considered an integral part of the Kisii people's way of life and culture as the study found out during the interview. Male Adulthood At about age twelve, boys have to undergo circumcision in order to become junior warriors. In order for a female member of the Maasai community to be considered socially adult, she has to undergo clitoridectomy (emorata). On the circumcision day, according to Hughes (2006), \"her father sacrificed a ram and brought honey-beer, to ensure that she would bear children\" (p. 20). Her head is shaved and she wears a special chain of tiny metal discs on her head to show that she is now ready to be a bride. Circumcision is, according to Spencer (1988), the \"immediate and most significant step\u2026, which places her in a ritual limbo between girlhood and wifehood (Okiya 2016).  Initiation brings each individual into the maturity of adulthood. It thus ushers one into marriage, itself a rite of passage. Bridewealth as a \"legitimation of children\" is an essential component of marriage because it has a social and religious value. It is the foundation for which families are built and a communication channel with the ancestors. Magesa brings in the theme of polygyny when he discusses \"the value behind different forms of marriage\" (Magesa 1997). He concludes his discussion of marriage in the context of kinship by discussing moral maturity in death. \"Longevity is a prized aspect of life \u2026 it   Association for the Promotion of African Studies is seen as a consequence and proof of having lived morally\" (Magesa 1997). In his discussion of marriage, he clearly illustrates how several themes are manifested in marriage (Magesa 1997). The role of the community includes the ancestors as the senior-most members of the community, family or lineage. When a dead African individual is considered an ancestor, he or she does not cease to be a member of the community, family or lineage of origin. And the role of the ancestors in marriage is underlined within the community, family or lineage of origin of the said individual. The central role of procreation in marriage further underlines the importance of the community because procreation facilitates the growth of the community (Magesa 1997). Based on the findings, the study found out that teachings and guidance, payment of bride price, wedding ceremony and meal sharing feasts were among the most significant rituals for marital stability. bride price was very significant, this is in agreement with Adams and Mburugu (1994) in their work on the Kikuyu in Kenya, who write that bridewealth (another term for bride price) is the primary indicator of marriage, with one respondent saying: 'There was no ceremony, but traditionally I am married because I paid the bride wealth.' With regard to the Sebei of Uganda, anthropologist Goldschmidt (1974) notes that without the transfer of bride price there is no marriage and any children will not belong to the father's lineage. Similar to this, a study conducted by Siwan A., Lori B., and Jean-Philippe P., (2018) where respondents were presented with emotions of frowning and smiling faces to visualize the scale. Based on the respondents' answers, on their self-reported happiness. The findings appear to suggest that a higher bride price is associated with a better marriage, where the wife is happier. The results agree with the existing literature of Conflict Theory by German philosopher and sociologist Karl Marx (1818\u20131883) who looks at society as a competition for limited resources. Polish-Austrian sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838\u20131909) expanded on Marx's ideas by arguing that war and conquest are the basis of civilizations and believed that cultural and ethnic conflicts led to states being identified and defined by a dominant group that had power over other groups (Irving 2007). Consequently, these results built on the existing evidence of this theory that suggests that the results should be taken into account when considering a step-by-step process of how to perform customs of the process of their marriage union. The data contributes a clear understanding of the various marriage rites that existed or still exist within the Abagusii people. On the other hand, it was interesting to note that, unlike conflict theorists that   Association for the Promotion of African Studies argue that family is not necessarily a group characterized by consensus. It might be held together by constraint or coercion. On the other hand, conflict theorists argue that harmony is not necessary for the continuation of order in the family.   This means that misunderstanding might even build strong relationships, making them rewarding in the final analysis (Stark (2007).  Unexpected results were a bit contrary is that still within the Kisii community, there were slight differences through which the rites were performed since some could take a longer period than others and in some clans, the series of rituals were intertwined yet within some clans, some rituals were performed in a different way or skipped. However, all the rituals were geared towards a common agenda. However, based on the findings of similar studies, a more plausible explanation is that all the rites practised aimed at a common agenda of stabilizing marriages and ensuring sustainability. Interestingly, the study found out that marriage sustainability was a community affair. This is in agreement with the communitarian aspect of Maasai culture and religion that accords the community a special place in the selection of the bride, proposal for marriage and negotiation of bride wealth. It was indicated by 115/163 (71%) respondents that the community or family members had a major role to investigate the family backgrounds of the partners (Okiya 2016). The generalizability of the research is limited by the fact that a small representative sample size was used to identify the participants for the focus group discussion. Problems encountered during data collection included language barriers that made it difficult to interpret and find the right words to describe some rituals or the exact rite that was involved. Or analyzed. The results presented are a qualitative part of the major research design that's an exploratory sequential design which is likely to contain richer and more comprehensive findings as compared to the first part. In conclusion, the results are valid despite the limitations because the focus group participants were carefully selected from the two counties occupied by the Abagusii community and most of them were over the age of seventy and have a vast knowledge of culture. However, it's important to note that some shortcomings related to the",

        "sentence_chunk": "traditional rituals were noted. For instance, if the girl was not a virgin, she was the only one victimised and sent back to her home or married as a second or subsequent wife. Secondly, in the case of barrenness, the woman was despised and sent away but for a man, another man in the clan was identified to sire children for him. Gender imbalance aspect is related to the findings of Vakili et al. ( 2014) showing that   Association for the Promotion of African Studies overall women were more likely to have dissatisfaction with their marriage and were more likely to complain. It might be related to patriarchy. In a patriarchal society like Iran, power is primarily held by adult men. Males predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property; and, in the domain of the family, fathers or father-figures hold authority over women and children similar to Thompson, Linda and Alexis J  Walker (1989) who claim that emotional differences between men and women might be another related factor to marital challenges.  ## Conclusion  It should be noted that this study identified fundamental cultural aspects that are still relevant in modern society for marriage stability. Marriage sustainability was a community affair. The two families nurtured it with the support of the clan members. The originality of this study lies in its strength-focused perspective on the deeper investigation into the traditional marriage rites and the impact on marital stability and the fact that its results can be applied to family establishments and for counsellors and therapists to take the initiative of stabilizing marriages.

This study looks at the pre-existing traditions of marriage(s), its values, beliefs and practices in Igbo land and the influence of the Western Judo-Christian cultural and religiosity which was passed unto us by the introduction of Christianity, Church and Canonical Laws into African Soil. The researcher approached this paper in a rather different genre, portraying a \"Marxist perspective\". The study thus, assumes that a qualitative research paradigm and method of data collection are interviews, and online research. Findings reveal deep rooted cultural differences (traditional and alien), which resulted in marriage clashes due to sometimes conceptual beliefs amongst the Christians and non-Christians alike. One such difference includes; the right of individuals to contract marriage without the consent of their parents in the West, whereas in Igbo land and more so in African context, marriage is seen as a union of two different families. In that respect, individuals cannot enter the contract of marriage without the sole express permission of their parents. Consequently, doing so would invalidate the marriage to a mere friendship without any form of legitimacy. Finally, compulsion is adhered to the traditional Igbo marriage custom while this is not the case in the Western cultural traditions. Thus, in this study, the researcher pertinently recommends respect to each method and to give to Caesar that which belongs to him and to GOD that which belongs to GOD.  ## Keywords  Traditional Marriage, Cultural, Bride-Price, Marxist Perspective, Igbo, Christianity, Osu, Igboland, Umunna, Ndi-Chie, Western Society, Igba-Nkwu, Chi-Ukwu  ## 1. Introduction  The emergence of clusters of traditions and cultural civilization of the wider Igbo society dominated the early centuries from 1408 to the present period. Throughout Africa, traditional or cultural marriages which provided the richness of natural continuity of life are fast fading out due to the influx of the alien Western culture. In Africa, especially in Igbo land, marriage is the only known and acceptable incubator for the raising of socially balanced and functional moral society (Children). Today that strong, socially acceptable core value of our culture and tradition of marriage as ordained by CHI-UKWU (the Almighty God) is gradually being eroded, thus giving way to the western styled church wedding. The reason is obvious, due principally, to the coming of the West, the influence of the Church, the appearance of the Christianity on many tribal lands of the Igbo and the Eurocentric missionaries; all of which have led to the disintegration of belief system within the Igbo society. The West have thus, deprived the Igbos' and the Africans in general, the reception and good nature of the customary marriage due to the so-called regular union arising from Sacramento's western styled church wedding (Atado, 1998).  As an example of method approach which examines the value of traditional marriage rights in Africa and the West (i.e., new world), this article would focus upon the Igbo land traditional marriage customs and what influence the invasion of the Western culture had on marriage value systems. The researcher approached this paper in a rather different genre, portraying a \"Marxist perspective\" for two reasons; firstly, the exposure of what was the archetypical system of the traditional and cultural values of the Igbos in its entirety as a result of the entrants of the Europeans into the traditional homeland of the Igbos. Secondly, Marxism provided the platform for critiquing marriage that was in existence prior, through the custom and tradition throughout the Igbo land, and then the influence of the West through the Church and Canonical laws. The researcher however, attempts to discuss the issues of traditional marriage in Igbo land and the influence of the Western culture as derived from interviews and online research by concentrating on the following headings and sub-headings.  ## 2. Background/Review Of Related Literatures  On a general note, the entrant of the Western culture into the traditional African cultures brought its own social and cultural norms in both the traditional, social and commercial scenes. According to Hastings' study on the mission of the Church in modern Africa, the present ecclesiastical instance on the observance of canonical form in Africa betrays the fundamental theology of marriage, namely, that the sacrament of matrimony is the sanctifying or the sanctification of a natural relationship, made effective by the people themselves and not by any sacred minister (Hastings, 1995). Culturally, there are enormous indispensable elements in Igbo marriage process, e.g., the payment of bride-price and the procurement of parental consent. The first step in the customary marriage process is always the initial encounter by both involving families, where the groom would visit the bride's immediate family. This visit is usually accompanied by the groom's father and where the father is disposed due to death or illness, the eldest member of the immediate family accompanies the groom. Culturally, this is only a visit and does not warrant any gift of item however, as goodwill, the groom and his family are free to go with kegs of palm wine, a bottle of hot drink (usually, a bottle of Schnapp) and kola nuts. So, on this day of appointment, the suitor's family would carry a keg of palm-wine, or a bottle of Schnapp, and cola nuts to the bride's family where intentions to marry their daughter is declared for the first time to the parents. The groom's father would introduce himself to the bride's parents, explaining the reason for their visit and officially announcing his son's interest in marrying their daughter. Following this declaration of interest, the bride's parents would then call out the bride-to-be to seek her knowledge of her suitor and to know whether she would want the suitor to marry her. What follows next will be determined by her response and if positive, the suitor and his father would be asked to proceed on the second phase which includes the investigations and discussion on the payment of bride-price. It is after this visit, that the bride's family would begin the process of investigation on the suitor's family. Likewise, the suitor's family would carry out their own investigation on the bride's family. This process of investigation starts immediately, following the suitor's family officially making initial appointment with the bride's family in order to declare their intention to marry their daughter. The importance of investigation cannot be overemphasised. The process which checks the background and history is thus, carried out in order to ensure that bride's family or the groom's family harbours no invisible hereditary disease, or are not once an \"Osu\" as is called in Iboland, otherwise called outcast in English language i.e.,  something dedicated to the idols, ostracised and as such becomes a taboo",

The investigation further checks for divorce rate, fertility rate, infidelity and bad behaviours in both families, but more to the bride's family.  The progress of the next meeting will then be determined by the satisfaction by all parties especially the bride's family who is interested on whether the groom-to-be might be man enough to take care of their daughter as well as their children. The next phase is the coming together of the two extended families: the bride's extended family called \"Umunna\" and the groom's family who can be as much as 20 - 25 people accompanying him. The crucial thing about this meeting is the reaffirmation by the groom's family that they are really interested in marrying from the other family in the presence of both extended families. The bride's family gives their consent and the bride is also consulted who gives her final consent. When this is established, then the traditional wedding date will be fixed and the list of bride-price may be given to the groom's family. On this visit, traditional Igboland custom demands that the groom takes along with him some gift items, such as kola nuts, kegs of palm-wine, cartons of beer, crates of soft drinks, packets of cigarettes, snuff, tobacco and probably a goat. These items would be shared amongst the two families in merriment. Following this phase is the engagement, negotiation and payment of bride price known traditionally as \"Ime ego\" in Igboland. Culturally, this aspect (bride price) differs slightly amongst different parts of Igboland. Usually, the amount of money paid as bride price is relatively small, and can be as little as 20 - 40 Naira, part of which would be handed back to the groom by the bride's father. It is the extra gift items the groom shall provide later on that actually constitutes the larger part of the bride price.  The acceptance of bride-price signifies, not only the support of the marriage by the two parties, but also the involvement of both sets of parents in the settlement of bride-price. Bride price in Igbo culture (also in other African and Asian cultures) is the transfer of physical cash or money from the groom to the parents or the family of the bride at the time of marriage agreement which signifies the acquisition of the rights by the groom, of the bride's labour and reproductive ability (Anderson, 2007). Therefore, the parental consent, the involvement of the two families (the bride and groom's family) and the payment of bride-price is seen by all and sundry as the concrete foundation that cements the marriage right, provides legitimacy as well as fostering true and lasting marriage without which there was no marriage (Anderson, 2007). The significance of the above factors, and especially the bride price cannot be over emphasised in a true and complete Igbo (African) traditional marriage rights. They therefore, fundamentally, signify a complete and total actualisation and fulfilment of Igbo traditional heritage which must be done before the bride and groom are pronounced as husband and wife in accordance to the native law and custom (Emecheta, 2011; Alewo & Olong, 2012). The bride-price or dowery consequently, is the only marital right which is generally accepted in all Igbo tradition to solidify marriage, without which there was no marriage. It is such a symbolic element of the marriage constructs that if peradventure, there are children, such children are not recognised by the groom's family, until bride price is paid. The bride-price therefore is a blood cleanser that removes shame and insults from the woman the moment she becomes legally married to her husband (i.e., after the bride price has been paid) in accordance to the tradition and culture, which again gives her honour and a sense of community value amongst her peers in her husband's home and his family (Eniola & Aremo, 2020). It provides peace of mind and respect because she cannot ordinarily be driven out of her husband's home, unless on the unfortunate event of problem arising from the marriage which results in separation. In this situation, bride-price paid must be returned back to the groom's family before the woman begins to contemplate marrying another man. Finally, if the woman in question is in abusive relationship and opts to back out, she cannot easily leave the marriage unless the dowery is returned and accepted by the groom's family. If the husband refuses to accept the refund, and the woman goes ahead and marries another man, the children from this new marriage automatically and traditionally, belongs to the first husband because legally, the woman still belongs to the first husband irrespective of the children.   Therefore, until the bride-price is accepted by the first husband and family, the woman is not due for another marriage. This could be likened to the English marriage divorce, where a woman cannot legally marry another man until she is fully divorced (Ryznar, 2010).  ## 2.1. **Movement Of People Across Cultures**  This period (1408-2008) witnessed the emergence of cluster of traditions and cultural civilization across the wider society. For the Igbos, it was the dilution, enfeeblement or watering down of their traditional principles and cultural heritage. The very core values of the tradition of marriage as ordained by CHI-UKWU (the Almighty God), and binding on the people. However, certain forces may account for this; firstly, the economic downturn in some parts of the world, the growth and emergence of new world economy that has fuelled the trans-Sahara movement. Thus, the peoples' movement across cultures and the influence of education has enabled marriage of convenience amongst individuals in the global scene. Secondly, the business of what I call; the developing countries immense contribution to this philosophy of change. With this change in culture, came attitudinal change, power domination of different kinds, mass movement of people for employment opportunities and the eventual quest for settlement wherever the boat landed.  Following the above, the question of the closeness of people with different traditional beliefs and cultural orientation seems unavoidable. Consequentially, the problem of tolerance and acceptability therefore arose out of the mixture of social and cultural values that are separate and distinctive and which, in effect ran contrastingly with one and another in the perspective of the people. Furthermore, as a result of this closeness, the chances of cultural war as groups fail to recognise each other's cultural presence and deportment within the society becomes inevitable. It follows therefore, that the struggle for recognition and cultural supremacy thus far, may go beyond the traditional plea for tolerance, thereby conceding the validity of society's disapproval and relying on its self-restraint (Parekh, 2000). There is no doubt the fact that humans feel more at peace with those of their own. They seem to rebel against imported and dappled traditions and cultures coming from other members of the society which were alien to them, and in this case, the western cultures.  The entrant of the Western culture into the traditional African cultures brought its own social and cultural norms in both the traditional, social and commercial scenes. They brought a cultural paradigm that encompasses all socio-economic aspects of the African traditions and in particular the Igbo cultural tradition, with the attendant policies for individualised and commercialised expansionist nature within the culture of (marriage). It must be noted here that this customised cultural imbibe may work well in certain cultures and may not be so suitable in other cultures. Since Adam (i.e., since the beginning of first man), the general principle of cultural and religious acceptability has always posed an issue amongst people and society. This paper deliberately looks at the intractable differences between the two different cultures, i.e., the African and the Western Society and the way this has impacted on the society at large.  ## 2.2. **The Concept Of Bride-Price**  In Igbo",

        "sentence_chunk": "traditional and cultural practices, the concept and practice of bride price (Emecheta, 2011) assume a seriously sensitive cultural issues, and where there was no bride-price paid culturally, marriage had not taken place. Although, the Igbo cultural practices have undergone some significant changes over the years, the concept of bride-price predates the arrival of the Western culture. Prior to independence in 1960, bride-price in Igbo land involves the settlement of marriages with items such as ornaments, cowries, bottles of schnapps, clothes, he-goats, fixed number of tubbers of yam, or kegs of palm-oil. At this time, cash was never in use and groom's parents provide the necessary economic support to their son. However, in today's Igbo traditional or cultural marriage, the emergence or the involvement of cash has become the practice and sometimes, outright negotiation of the amount to be paid is undertaken by both parents taking into cognisance the level of wealth of the groom and educational level of the bride. Usually, the bride's family determines the amount of money to be paid by the groom's family. The determinant factors differ from region to region and from town to town. In some parts of Igbo nation, the bride's parents provide a numbered bride-price list to be handed over to the groom upon request. Sometimes, this list is negotiated and pruned to accommodate the financial wealth and statues of the groom especially where the bride is not well educated. This article explores the traditional African (the Igbo) marriage culture and the influence of the western cultural practices.  ## 2.3. **An Overview Of Igbo Society**  Who are the Igbos? the Igbos are found in the Southern part of Nigeria. They are one of the three main tribes in Nigeria with population numbering over 60 million. The Igbo people have been quoted as having migrated from the Jewish kingdom (Bruder, 2008). They are the descendants of Eri, the fifth son of Gad, Gad being the seventh son of Jacob, and Jacob being one of the sons of Abraham as indicated in the book of Genesis (Genesis 46: 15-18, & Numbers 26: 16-18). They are therefore referred to as the black Jews who traversed Sahara Desert from Egypt with some companions before the exodus of Israelites from Egypt (Oduah, 2013). Eri and his companions had travelled to the Southern parts of Nigeria through river-water where they then came to settle at the confluence of Ezu and Omambala rivers in in present-day Aguleri, Anambra State. The Igbos are one of the most influential tribes in Nigeria known for their resilience, business acumen and hardworking characteristics, intelligence, enterprising and entrepreneurial spirit.   The Igbo speaking people are one of the ethnic groups located in the south-eastern part of Nigeria with unique cultural and traditional heritage. Politically, every clan, village or town is an autonomous unit, and can determine its method of governance besides settling matters affecting it through meeting of their elders and title holders. The elders constitute a permanent body called Ndi-chie: the rulers and administrators of general affairs of the community, charged with legislative, executive and judicial functions in the society, for which they discharge without encumbrance. There is no separation of powers; those who make the laws also interpret and execute them by delegating for implementation. One may sometimes ask; does governance reside in one chief? The answer is no, governance is a shared responsibility of all, though it hovers around those entrusted to carry out the day-to-day functions and mandates of its people in order to discharge justice. However, there are no women amongst this group; women are mainly treated as passive, receptive, vulnerable and as reproducers. They are therefore not strong enough to face the challenges of the time. The Igbo Marxists adopted the strategy of exclusionism and of power to dominate, possess and penetrate women in order to keep the wheels of human procreation continuously spinning. The effects of domination associated with this power would arise not from appropriation and deployment by a subject, but from manoeuvres, tactics, techniques and functioning (Smart, 2002). I will like to talk about other main issues surrounding the subject.  This article however, will tackle some of the resilient and seemingly intractable issues in the traditional African marriage customs, and the influence exerted by the Western culture. In adapting a Marxist approach, I summarize how I believe Marxist's thought in Igbo tradition has developed during the period 1408-2008 and where it might go in the future. First, I summarize the evolution of coming of the Western society from the 15th century upwards, focusing on liberal, radical, and Marxist-socialist capitalism. Next, I summarize the conception of marriage in Igbo land, the meaning and how it was carried out, taking a narrative approach, analysing the philosophical factor underpinning the custom. Third, I will critique with comparison the almighty bride-price concept and the Western cultural system. The last part will conclude that the bride-price had some significance both in the African and the Western context.   ## 2.4. **Research Questions**  Based on the main research objectives and the theoretical underpinnings of the traditional marriage concepts in Igbo land and the entrant of the Western society, this study specifically seeks to answer the following research questions.   1) To what extent has pre-existing Igbo traditional marriage conditions been affected by the coming of the Western civilization?  2) To what extent does interrelatedness of cultures affect the institution of marriage in Igbo land?   3) To what extent does movement of people across cultures affect belief systems and marriage acceptability in Igbo land?  ## 3. Methodology  This article is a qualitative research study and our approach for data collection is based on interview and online research of the tradition and culture of the Igbos dating back to 1400 AD. The use of online is necessitated by the nature of the question. Initially, literature search was conducted on various journals and books in an attempt to gain an overview of the issues of discourse associated with the Igbos' traditions and culture generally. Following from the above, a qualitative survey, involving two traditional indigenes of the Igbo descent was also undertaken in order to gather further context rich opinions, perceptions and views, based on individual knowledge, history and experience in relation to the subject. The survey was conducted in an atmosphere of openness; it included an open-minded session on how the traditional and cultural oriented marriages have shifted, how the traditions were observed and conducted before, and what is obtainable at the moment.  The paper also made use of researcher's personal experience and understanding of the culture and tradition of the Igbo people. Developing from the above, the researcher who is himself an insider of the culture and tradition of the Igbos draws upon both the literature and the experiences to develop an essay approach with a different style of genre, the Marxist style. Reflecting on Marxist approach and the interpretation of Igbo cultural marriage alongside the Western tradition of marriage on itself, the author illustrates his comments with some idiomatic expressions which littered all over the text as well as comments from references to Ezeokeke, Afikpo, Shaw, Anderson, Atado, Bruder, Nduka & Ozioma, Adrian, Parekh, and Okeke to mention a few.   Bruder, (2008), begins by tracing the origin of the Igbo people as having migrated from the Jewish kingdom and are the descendants of Eri, the fifth son of Gad. Gad was one of the sons of Jacob, and Jacob the son of Abraham (Genesis 46: 15-18, & Numbers 26: 16-18). Igbos have also been described as one of the most influential tribes in Nigeria known for their resilience, business acumen and hardworking characteristics, intelligence, enterprising and entrepreneurial spirit.

        "sentence_chunk": "the shores of the Igboland provides that the Portuguese were the first to arrive in Igboland in the middle of fifteenth century. This was followed by the Dutch and the British in the seventeenth and eighteenth century respectively. What were they actually looking for out of their own shore? Could it be the result of cold and hunger? Africans were living in perfect peace at this time, proving policies and laws guiding their natural existence, marrying and giving in marriages until the arrival of these aliens. These foreigners purposely came to Igbo land in search of slaves, gold and copper. When the slavery was abolished in 1807, they diverted their mission economically on raw materials such as palm produce, elephant tusks, and timber. At this point, they appeared more aggressively oppressive in dealing with Africans who have now began to experience intimidation, wars and confrontations from the Europeans. As Foucault puts it; \"concept forms human beings\" thus the arrival and oppressive behaviour of the foreigners began to produce a new form of reasoning amongst the Igbos. Taking a look on the mission of the church in Africa, Adrian Hasting profiles the present ecclesiastical instance on the observance of canonical form in Africa which he says betrays the fundamental theology of marriage where the sacrament of matrimony is the sanctification of a natural relationship, made effective by the people themselves and not by any sacred minister (Hastings, (1995). Lamenting on this, Atado (1988) comments on the general possibility of profiling the West as having deprived the Igbos and indeed Africans in general the reception and good nature of the customary marriage as a result of the so-called regular union arising from Sacramento's Western Church wedding. On his part, Parekh (2000) insists that by mixing different cultures which resulted in marriage of convenience brought about by the coming of the West, the very core values of traditional marriage concept appeared to have been diluted. Thus, the struggle for recognition and cultural supremacy which went beyond the traditional plea for tolerance, thereby conceding the validity of society's disapproval and relying on its self-restraint (Parekh, 2000). Finally, the issue of bride price in traditional Igbo culture entails the exchange of money from groom to bride' s family specifically, as complex and holistic. Thus, signifying the acquisition of the rights by the groom, of the bride's labour and reproductive ability (Anderson, 2007).  ## 3.1. **Marxist Approach**  The first Igbo contact with the Europeans was in the middle of the fifteenth century with the arrival of the Portuguese. This was followed by the Dutch and the British in the seventeenth and eighteenth century respectively (Ezeokeke, 2018; Afigbo, 1981; 2011; Shaw, 1970). These Europeans came to Igbo land in search of slaves to buy. The abolition of slavery in 1807 ushered in a new wave of trade epoch. The European now shifted interest economically on raw materials, for example, palm produce, elephant tusks, and timber. Standpoint epistemology deals with the way individuals experience something and Africans have experienced intimidation, wars and oppressive confrontations from the West. Firstly, from the Arabs, and secondly from the Europeans, thus were forced to give Europeans' access to the hinterland. Foucault (1972) expressed that 'Concepts' form human beings, thus the arrival of Europeans began gradually to produce a new form of reasoning among the Igbos.  The traditional Igbo society believes in a strong family cohesion with power relation dominated by male. The people thrive on the notion of patriarchies which recognises male gender through paternal power (Nduka & Ozioma, 2019), enabling them to hold more powers and privileges in the society. Traditionally, marriage among the Igbos transcends the notion of marriage as a bilateral contract or a \"contract of convenience\" seen as a covenant between two Umunnas (extended families) concretised in the spouses and binding existential. Neither the man nor the woman may derogate from or abrogate the sealed covenant without the knowledge of the two clans. The philosophy underlying this legal bond is \"I am because we are, and since we are, therefore I am\" It is a communal faith in equitable and just relationship between two people representing two autonomous clans. The underlying philosophical principle in the circumstance was to seal permanently an accord and war treaty between the two villages which will usher in peace, love and prosperity.   Through customary marriage, many relationships arise: economically and politically. It enhances trading and nullifies inter and intra-village disputes. Legally, a person's judicial rights are protected by the mother's agnates, if he is convicted of sorcery, then they will shelter him. There are two Igbo proverbs in support of this; \"Woman is used to clear and maintain the passage of communication in foreign land\" Another says, \"The part of marriage is the part that leads to the stream and is always open\". Stream is used here as a source of life, which may not shut her doors to the people she serves. These proverbs epitomise the human relationship initiated by marriage alliance. Through marriage, healthy relationships are established between the villagers, people regard each other as \"brothers\" and \"sisters\" and children from the marriage know they have a second home outside of their own homes.   ## 3.2. **The Concept Of Marriage In Igbo Land**  A marriage in Igbo tradition involves a whole series of prestation (\"Prestation\" is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as \"the act of paying, in money or service, what is due by law or custom\") from the husband and his kin to the wife's kin. The Igbos would want to avoid the impression that the marital contract is in fact a sale or transaction. Hence the Igbo adage, \"A man's debt to his in-laws can never be fully repaid\". Thus, means that when we marry a wife, we must go on paying until we die. This however, justifies mutual interests between the in-laws and of course, gave the father in-law a slight edge over his son in-law. In the Western tradition, such act of service and mutual involvement does not take place. In fact, the closest one gets is the custom of giving the ring which was adopted from the Romans as a pledge to marry, which, also stood for marital contract among the Germans. The Franks followed the same procedure and bridegroom paid the wittum: (a wittum was a sum of money paid in compensation which indicated that somebody was protected). It became customary at this time (1563), that objects and practices such as the arrha (money), the ring, the bride-price, the veiling derived from Germanic, Frankish, Celtic, Longobardic, and Gothic tribes were thus incorporated into the custom of the societies (Atado 1988).  In Igbo custom, the whole process of settlement is regulated; as the Igbos say, by the philosophy of the dog, \"If I fall down for you and you fall down for me, it is a play\". In other words, the settlement of bride-price is pervaded by humorous spirit and it involves no harshness or cantankerous bargaining of any kind. In other words, it is neither transactional, nor sales of any sorts. The ceremonies accompanying the payment of bride-price, though hugely diverse, elucidate the covenantal and religious ramifications of settlement. Unfortunately, the Igbo tradition appears not to give credence to man knelling before the girl lady to make propositions for marriage as it pertains to the modern kind of Western styled proposal where the bridegroom gets down on one knee to make propositions to his groom.  ## 3.3. Getting Married In Igbo **Land**  In traditional African culture especially the Igbos, when a boy thinks he ought to get married, he first informs his father of his wish and intention. Then his situation is vetted to make sure he can support a wife and possibly a family (Okeke 1986). The family now starts to look for a wife for him. \"The African marries and then falls in love\", so the saying goes. The young man who now wants to marry may or may not have a say in the choice of his",

        "sentence_chunk": "partner to be. The same also applies to the girl. In Igbo culture, it is not a matter for two individuals to decide; you get married to, or you marry into a family chosen for you. Usually, the families undergo a vetting order for any criminal records or any deadly diseases. This aspect of the fundamentals of marriage (vetting) predates making any marriage intentions known to the other family and must be carried out to the highest order before the marriage takes place.   ## 3.4. **The Influence Of The \"Western Society\"**  In Western culture, marriages may be contracted without the knowledge of the two families and parental consent sometime is not sought. \"A boy meets a girl and they fall in love and later decide to marry and agree on it\". They then inform their parents about it and all is arranged (Okeke 1986). The underlying philosophical and cultural assumption in this instance could be based on Judeo-Christian religious backgrounds and Greco-Roman law. Right from the time of the decretals to the Council of Trent, legislation had supported the validity of marriage contracted without parental consent. The capacity of persons is determined by the natural law, the State and the customary law for the un-baptised, and by the canonical law for those who are baptised or received into the church.   In 1198 Pope Innocent 111 declared that only the consent of the contracting parties was necessary for a valid marriage. Thus, has since become part of the cultural norms of the West (Atado, 1988) and has remained so.  Consequently therefore, an individual in the Western society is free to choose his or her own marital partner; (a practice that is abhorred in Igbo traditions and culture) parents and kinsmen were not normally involved and therefore neither made the choice nor entered into marriage negotiations on behalf of the partners. Young people reaching the legal age in the West enjoyed a great deal of freedom in the choice of marriage partners based on the aforementioned cultural, religious or canonical, state and customary laws of the society.  However, in the recent time, a new wave of marriage practice has begun to emerge among many educated Africans. This is marriage without family consent, contracted as a result of direct influence of the 'Christian - Western' culture brought about by well-travelled and educated Africans, who see traditional practices as inhibiting and narrow-minded. These new educated African elites returned home imbued with nationalism and reformative mind sets, believing to make vital cultural contributions towards influencing traditional institution of marriage in Africa. Their new adopted way of life being responsible, stood between two traditional and cultural values. For example, in a study conducted by Nwoko, \"The Changing Nature and Patterns of Traditional Marriage Practices among the Owerre-Igbo, a Subgroup of the Igbo of Southeast Nigeria\" which examines the acculturation that shapes the contemporary social construct of marriage in Igboland and in particular the Owerri-Igbo social enclave, the study found the following three phenomena to be responsible: 1) the extensive contacts which the Owerre-Igbo have had with other ethnic groups, 2) the influence of Christianity and Western education, and 3) occupational influence (Nwoko, 2020).  Although, some authors also see the traditional marriage practices as repugnant: they believe that \"it is helping to refine some of the obnoxious beliefs and practices of Igbo race\" (Okeke, Ibenwa, & Okeke, 2017). Nonetheless, their ideas did not go far enough in changing the orthodoxy and tradition of marriage in certain parts of Africa, especially among the Igbo race because of lack of mutual-cultural recognition. Mutual-cultural recognition acknowledges the common benefits, interests and goals of a particular race (Berger et al., 2008). In this context, the Igbo race. Conversely, the culture of the Igbos favours patriarchal system thus, the general believes that traditional orthodoxy in marriage rights within the Igbo race or indeed within Africa, needs to be maintained, sustained and celebrated without undue alteration irrespective of our Western education. On the other hand, while acknowledging the agency of Western cultural influence by well-educated Africans, I argue that many Africans' would-be spouses/couples have appeared to shape their marriage rights towards, rather than away from traditional and cultural norms, actually embraced the concept and the rituals, believing the significance to be a worthwhile cultural identity.   ## 4. Critical Analysis And Result 4.1. Critical Analysis Of Igbo Traditional Marriage And Western Styled Wedding  The significance of bride-price in marriages within the Igbo land can be compared with the wedding in early England: where the bridegroom first swore according to God's right and circular law, waging (pledging himself) to the girl's for speakers, to have her in such a way as he should hold by God's right as his wife, and his kinsmen would stand pledge for him. In such circumstance, the price of \"up-fostering\" the bride was interpreted as compensation to the bride's immediate family. Similarly, among the Igbos, the bride-price is conceived as a sign of appreciation and gratitude to the bride's immediate family for rearing her: it is therefore a pledge of fidelity and commitment made by the groom and his people to the bride and her kin. This pledge is water tight and must be seen by all to be so. Though, it must go without saying that the bride-price alone does not confer to the groom, the onus and powers of husband-ship until traditional wine carrying otherwise called \"Igba-nkwu\" has taken place.  Conceivably, the payment of bride-price in Igbo land guarantees the legal transfer of the woman from the patria potestas to the authority of her husband and his kin. In the early English marriage, this process was called \"the transfer of the woman's mund from the father to the husband. Furthermore, bride-price specifies the right and corresponding duties of a husband and wife, and of the parent vis-\u00e0-vis their children.\" Meek (1937) aptly enunciates the legal bond that arises from the payment of bride-price: \"It further guarantees that the husband shall have the custody of any children born; for in the absence of bride-price a woman's children are claimed by her family (Custody of the children is decided not solely in terms of physiological or biological paternity). Traditionally, bride-price guarantees that the husband shall have the continuous services of a wife for himself and of a mother for his children, and that a wife and the offspring produced shall have a permanent home, and be supported by her husband. It thus prevents wife from leaving her husband for some trivial cause(s),\" as it is commonly the case in the Western civilization, where a minor economic problem may lead to dissolution of a marriage through devoice and children (if any) from the marriage becomes subject to court decision. Psychologically, the bride price in Igbo land is naturally symbolic in the sense that it adds value, honour and dignity to the bride. This is even so, since any marriage contracted without the bride price for any reason whatsoever in Igboland is considered incomplete in the first place. Culturally and unfortunately, the woman involved in such marriage contract is believed to be given out free of charge, and therefore, is considered not fully married. More so, the woman in question will always feel inferior and less valued within the family where she was married into and even amongst her peers. This act, obviously affects her full integration into her husband's wider family. Conversely, such practice however, is not common or not obtainable in the western socio-cultural domain. The Western marriage culture did not see any issue attached to the payment of bride price, hence, a woman and a man on their own accord can cohabit with or without the consent of their parents and continue procreation if they so wish. Be it as it may conform to their life style and culture, such practice would be a taboo in Igbo land wherefore children are created without proper",

        "sentence_chunk": "marriage rights, such children created in that manner would be called bastards and may not have the full legal right of possession in the family properties.  Nevertheless, due to colonisation and the impact of Western socio-cultural activities, traditional method of marrying a wife in Igboland have appeared to unavoidably been corrupted and disrupted. The traditional Igbo marriage practice was seen to be decreasing at an increasing rate and gradually being replaced with a scandalous mercantile procedure. In effect, the institution of bride-price has become commercialised in Igbo society, not sorely on the bride price but also on the entire ceremonies surrounding marriages in Igbo society. Not surprisingly, with the growth of the economy of nations, the amount of bride-price began to escalate, and thus precipitated many distressing and lamentable problems in the society. The question now is; can we reject the African heritage in favour of the alien values and cultures? The answer is neither to reject the alien values and cultures nor to substitute with African heritage in all spheres of people's lives, but an incorporation and development of the Igbo traditions, values and culture in philosophy, theology and Christianity as Rev. Atado (1988) has observed which might improve and strengthen the institution of marriage in Igbo land.  ## 4.2. **Summary Of Research Findings**   Whereas it is the right of individuals to contract marriage without the consent of their parents in the Western culture, the Igbo society abhors this tradition; in fact, in Igboland and more so in African context, marriage is seen as a union of two different families.   Notably, among Igbos, the bride-price is conceived as a sign of appreciation and gratitude to the bride's immediate family for rearing her: the concept which is not obtainable in the Western society marriage rights.    Payment of bride-price in Igbo land guarantees the legal transfer of the woman from the patria potestas to the authority of her husband and his kin, again this aspect of tradition does not exist in the Western society. The legal transfer of the woman can only be witnessed either in the case of Court marriages or the Church Wedding.   whereas it is right to cohabit and procreate children in the Western marriage, it is rather a taboo to create children without proper marriage rights in Igbo tradition and such children created in that manner would be called bastards and may not have the full legal right of possession in the family properties.   Finally, due to the influence of the Western culture in Igbo society, the institution of bride-price has become commercialised, not sorely on the bride price but also on the entire ceremonies surrounding marriages in Igbo society thus, the amount of marrying a girl has escalated astronomically.  ## 5. Conclusion  In conclusion, therefore, the researcher re-visits the fundamental issues of African (the Igbo) traditional marriage customs and the influence of the western styled marriages. Marriage and Family, according to NCTC (2010), are the study of the problems of mate selection, courtship, conflict resolution, childrearing, common relationship issues, marriage adjustment, divorce and remarriage. Although, this definition is apparent in both cultures, it is more visible and adaptive in African Igbo traditional and cultural setting than it is in western culture.   This genre paper examined the traditional culture and the invasion of the Western liberal practices (Okeke 1986). \"The researcher adopted a Marxist perspective in this genre paper\" for two reasons; firstly, in order to explain or expose the insanity of the traditional and cultural contamination that characterized the early entrants of the West into the traditional homeland of the Igbos.   Secondly, Marxist perspective was particularly helpful, since it enabled the researcher to critique both the custom and tradition of marriage that had existed in Igbo land prior, and the influence of the West through the Church and Canonical laws. By merit, meaning, belief, adoption and application, marriage in African setting (i.e., the Igbos) is radically different from marriage setting in the Western world (the Europeans and Americans). It is however, true to say that African tradition and culture brings many rich values into a marriage but it can also bring its own crop of problems with it.  However, in conclusion therefore, the researcher is of the opinion that religious beliefs, education, and western civilization have independent association with Igbo traditional marriage concepts; adequate intervention is needed therefore, to address the social and culturally-laden norms that vary amongst the traditional Igbo marriage and custom which was brought about by Western culture.  ## Conflicts Of Interest  The author declares no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.  ## References  Afigbo, A.

The greatest concentrations of the Gidar can be found in two cities of this region: Guider, seat of the Mayo Louti Prefecture, and Figuil. Other large clusters of the Gidar are found around the villages of Lam, Djougi, and Bidzar, on the banks of the Mayo Louti (from Mayo Loue all the way to Figuil), and around Sorawel4.   There is only a rather modest amount of literature dedicated to the Gidar. The first extensive publication on the history of the region was the work of colonial administrator Jacques Lestringant5. The next important publication was authored by Chantal Collard, who conducted sociological research among the Gidar6. The most extensive study of the culture (especially religious culture) of the Gidar was a publication of Antoni Kurek, OMI, based on research of that region conducted from 1976 to 19777. Also worthy of mention is the contribution of Polish missionaries to the development of literature in the Gidar language8.  In addition to the aforementioned literature, the author has also referred to his own field research, conducted in 1991-1993, 2001 and 2011, and to auxiliary literature.  In Cameroon we deal with three types of marriage: traditional, universally practiced marriage; civil marriage9, required by state law before entering into a religious marriage; and, finally, sacramental marriage. Most widespread is the traditional form of contracting marriage. This article will present this particular form, referring to Gidar traditions and also showing its similarities to, and differences from, the Christian tradition brought by the missionaries. It will also propose solutions which combine the two traditions.  ## I. Gidar Marriage According To Traditional Law  Gidar rites of passage were celebrations of ties with the ancestral and territorial community, of the willingness to submit to its laws, orders, prohibitions, of and respect for the value of this community and for all of its rules of life. Consequently, each rite was associated with the obtaining of relevant rights and the taking on of the obligations arising from them. This concerned birth, initiations, marriages, and funeral rites, by which a member of the community passed on to the members of his family abiding beyond the visible world. A characteristic feature of rites of passage was their multi-stage nature. They were not single acts but events long prepared and celebrated with suitable gestures, symbols and words. The individual, successive stages of \"taking a wife\" consisted of the choice of a spouse, accepted by both families; an engagement period; an act by both families of acknowledgement of joining the young persons as one in marriage; the conveying of the bride to her husband's home; celebrating; and paying the matrimonial fee.  ## 1. Traditional Conditions For Marital Consent  Marriage among the Gidar as in marriage all over sub-Saharan Africa is not as a rule the decision of the young persons but of their parents or even of the elders of the clan10. It is after all a contract between two families (in the broad sense of the term), and therefore, the family has a significant influence over the choice of a spouse. Although in the present day there is a noticeable, steadily increasing, transition from marriage organized by the family to marriage based on personal consent, as a rule the old matrimonial principles are still in force, based on clan exogamy (marriage of related persons should be avoided) and ethnic endogamy (you must marry someone within your ethnic group) and territorial endogamy (generally, you marry someone from a specific area). A second notable tendency is a slow transition from polygyny to monogamy. Polygyny is however still present among the Gidar and throughout Africa in spite of some laws restricting it.   A third trend also slowly coming around is a shift from joint ownership within a clan to individual inheritance.  Traditional Gidar marriage follows all-African and local trends and is more a covenant between two families than a union of two persons. Entering into such a covenant requires broader consent, and it is part of family policy. From then on (after the marriage takes place), the two clans will be joined by the gift of the woman  (from her family to her spouse's). The marriage covenant is seen above all as a necessary means for extending the life of the clan: a woman belonging to one family bestows the gift of her fertility unto another family as her children will belong to the lineage of her husband. Since in the local religious tradition the givers of life are primarily the ancestors, this passage of a woman-mother to another family must be lawful, i.e., in accordance with the will of the father and his family (including deceased ancestors)11.  In giving a woman to a family with whom there are friendly relations, compensation is expected in the form of a matrimonial fee. This payment is made to the bride's family. Fees consist of money, livestock, labor, etc. The marriage is not final until the last payment has been made.  ## 2. Obstacles Preventing Or Dissolving Marriage  We can also find in the Gidar tradition obstacles which prevent or break up marriage. In the Gidar language the term for an obstacle to marriage is *henzin*.  The first obstacle to contracting marriage - and in the case of entering marriage unaware of this obstacle, of annulling it - is kinship. The rules of exogamy are restrictive and apply to all relatives of the whole family. Since clans are often large and may not necessarily all be living in the same territory, mistakes can occur. In such a case, the elders pass a sentence annulling the marriage and special purification rites are performed. Marriage is also prevented by certain close relationships, and also by ties resulting from the adoption of a child. Another obstacle dissolving marriage is impotence of the husband (in Gidar terminology: *gemen mement* - \"dead member\") for the primary task of marriage is to produce offspring. Moreover, according to tradition, a girl getting married should be a virgin (*mbugbo*). If this were not the case, it would be an obstacle to the marriage: the girl would return home to her parents covered in shame. Today, as a rule this is no longer treated as an obstacle to marriage12.  Infertility on the part of the woman (*ndarzlay*) could also lead to invalidation of the marriage. At the same time, as a rule it is the woman who is blamed if there are no children13. If a young married woman turns out to be infertile, the husband returns her to her father and his matrimonial fee is reimbursed. Another obstacle nullifying marriage was the spouse's not meeting all payments provided for in the already agreed-upon matrimonial fee to be paid to the bride's parents. The issue of seniority could also be a hindrance preventing marriage: tradition followed the principle that the eldest daughter would be the first to marry, after that her younger sisters, in order of age14.  ## 3. Marriage Forms  There are four basic forms of Gidar marriages: a) the multi-stage, full marriage rites, which end when the final payment of the matrimonial fee is remitted b) marriage contracted before the final payment of the marriage fee has been made c) marriage through abduction of the girl d) widow inheritance under leviratic law. Getting married does not require the presence of any religious leader, nor of any other person representing the community as a whole. It is above all else a contract between two clans.  Elaborate marriage rituals are, however, religious. These religious foundations come from the bond between the world of the living with the world of deceased ancestors, including the founding ancestor of the given tribe, clan, or lineage. The deceased ancestors continue to be involved in the daily events of",

        "sentence_chunk": "family life, especially during sowing and harvesting, initiation and marriage. If the family is treated as a large chain whose living members form one group, family law has its roots in the religious and at the same time invisible world. Offerings made to ancestors at various stages of the multi-stage process of marriage attest to this. These are meant to procure their \"blessing\" to the marriage.  Despite the prevalence of polygamous marriage, many traditions emphasize the fact that only the marriage to a first wife is entitled to the full marriage ritual.  ## 4. The Multi-Stage, Full Marriage Ritual  The contracting of marriage is composed of several stages. The first of these is preparation for marriage, which can be divided into more remote (the search for marriage candidates) and immediate (the engagement itself, begun with a proposal; visiting the future in-laws) stages.  Further preparation for marriage includes the initiative of the future father of the family. One of the ways in which this is expressed is in the Gidar vocabulary, which for the term \"get married\" has only one phrase: *ugum gulku*, \"take a woman\". When the father of the marriage candidate and his older brothers accept a proposed candidate for his wife, the boy becomes *agmuk gulku*, \"the one who has taken himself a woman\". The parents of the girl have not yet expressed agreement to the marriage of their daughter. The boy then asks his chosen one, in the presence of her mother, whether she wants to be his wife. After she has consented, he turns to his future father-in-law. After his agreement - and the agreement of the elders of the clan - the first installment of the marriage fee is made over. Traditionally, this was a gift of millet, tobacco, and hens, treated as a type of a proposal.   After paying this first installment, the parents of the affianced meet together. This is the final sign of agreement. Later the amount of the entire fee paid to the girl's father is determined. After receiving the consent of the girl's father, the young man becomes *aratuk gulku*, \"the one who has found himself a woman\".  The actual marriage ceremonies are called *udaha* among the Gidar. They consist of seven stages: ubassa, ubele, udama, ungla, *uka, ute glo* and *upedde*.  The verb *ubassa* means \"to place a stone on something\". It is a kind of security, and in the marriage rites it therefore means the same as \"engaged\".  The second stage - *ubele* - means \"bringing the girl\" to her in-laws' compound. This, however, does not give the young people the right to have intercourse. The bride-to-be gets acquainted with the family of her future husband, and the family in turn observes this candidate. Their assessment of the candidatefor-wife influences the amount of the subsequent installment of the matrimonial fee. The interval between *ubassa* and *ubele* can last even up to two years - it depends on the wealth of the groom (matrimonial fee installments). In the past udama, that is, hiding from the in-laws, was also practiced.  The next stage is uka, \"relocating\" the girl to the boy's compound. The \"setting up of the hearth\", *ute glo*, then takes place there; this was the most important part of the marriage rites. Beside the hut the young wife places three stones which will be the hearth for her kitchen. An approved formula such as, \"glo nok yanka! - here is your hearth!\" is then repeated. From then on she is no longer a *gorku*, that is, a \"girl\", but a *gulku*, a \"woman (wife)\".  On the following day everyone would gather in the compound of the young husband for the *upedde*, the banquet after the wedding night15.  ## 5. Incomplete Marriage Rites  It can be called an incomplete marriage ritual when there are difficulties in paying the marriage fee. It sometimes happens that, in spite of preliminary arrangements, new financial demands are made of the son-in-law. The Gidar proverb says, \"*ariya nakat gulku agrakba* - the marriage fee never comes to an end\". Then the candidate for a wife may be \"abducted\". This, however, does oblige the husband to pay the entire fee, though at a later date.  Another form of marriage is what is known as \"kidnapping\" the girl. This happens when the young people (the boy and the girl) fall in love but for various reasons (such as the boy's family being too poor to pay the marriage fee) they cannot marry. The \"kidnapping\" usually takes place at night and is only possible with the agreement of the girl. It is she herself who leaves her parents' compound in secret and goes off to an agreed-upon meeting with her lover, or simply vanishes in other circumstances. As a rule, such marriages enjoy favor with the local community.   However, \"kidnappings\" do not always work out well16.  ## 6. Leviratic Law  Yet another form of marriage is \"inheriting the wife\" and her children, after the death of a brother or close relative (leviratic law). This springs from many reasons, including the obligation to take care of the family of the deceased brother.   But usually the widow is left free to choose a new husband. Among the Gidar, candidates were presented to the widow immediately after the funeral ceremonies brothers of the deceased with the intention of marrying her and accepting her children. Sometimes, other men belonging to the clan also present themselves. The widow herself makes the decision, handing the chosen one a calabash filled with beer. The one who receives it would take the widow and her children to his home. If she did not choose any of them but went to a man from another clan, this man would be obliged to pay a marriage guarantee to the eldest living brother who - according to the law - was the heir.17 In this case, the offspring born of the woman in this new marriage would legally belong to the deceased, and she would continue to be considered the wife of the deceased.  Leviratic law originated from and functions in a broad socio-cultural framework which includes kinship systems, family models, local societal organizations, and traditional beliefs.  The levirate upholds and completes all existing references and arrangements, from maintaining the relationship between two clans and following up with the marriage contract and payment, to the relationship of the ancestors of the deceased by raising up progeny for him.  ## 7. The Marriage Fee  Another important element upon entering into marriage was the marriage fee, which has already been mentioned several times, in Gidar *ariya nakat gulku*.   Translated literally, this means \"riches for a wife\", or also \"the price of a wife\".   Originally, the marriage fee was not understood by the Gidar as *ariya* (\"riches\",  \"price\"). It was rather a symbolic compensation for giving over a woman to another clan; it was a sign of a covenant between the clans, a ritual proof of consecration in marriage and evidence of the resourcefulness of the groom-to-be. Without it, the relationship was seen as cohabitation, and the man had no authority in the family. The marriage fee was regarded as a sign of responsibility of the man for the woman. It guaranteed mutual respect between the spouses and constituted a separation of the wife from her family. It was also an expression of the recognition of the husband's family for that of the wife's. It guaranteed the wife's attachment to her husband and strengthened mutual fidelity between the spouses. It was only after payment of the marriage fee that the parents gave the young wife their blessing. In more recent times, however, these positive aspects have been receding further and further into the background and giving way to desires for wealth, a result of changes related to the emergence of money. The amount of the marriage fee gets higher every year and is the cause of many conflicts between clans18.  ## Ii. Christian Marriage And Local Traditions  Christianity, which has gradually been coming into northern Cameroon for over 70 years, brings with it a different view of marriage. From the very beginning, the tradition of the Church has treated marriage as a union between a man and a woman, based on a contract (covenant), expressed [by them] consciously and freely. This contract,",

        "sentence_chunk": "when entered upon by baptized persons, has been raised to the dignity of a sacrament by Christ Our Lord. Its essential attributes are therefore unity and indissolubility, which in Christian marriage acquire a special strength by the power of the sacrament, \"For as God of old made Himself present to His people through a covenant of love and fidelity, so now the Savior of men and the Spouse of the Church comes into the lives of married Christians through the sacrament of matrimony\"19.  The sacramentality of Christian marriage has been a subject of the teaching of the Church from the very beginning, although no strict terminology has been developed.  The Church in northern Cameroon recognized traditional marriages contracted outside of baptism as valid and licit, provided that local principles, e.g., payment of a marriage fee, were taken into account. If either of the parties accepted baptism, the marriage became for him or her sacramental. If the other party also made the same decision later on, their union took on a sacramental character, without a need to renew the marriage vows. Controversy would, however, arise if attempts were made to contract a traditional marriage if one party was [already] baptized, or if both parties were baptized. These controversies mainly concerned the unity, indissolubility, and sacramentality of marriage.  ## 1. The Issue Of The Unity Of Marriage  An essential attribute of Christian marriage is its \"unity,\", which has its source in the will of God, expressed in the Book of Genesis and repeated by Jesus Christ, \"[A] man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, and the two of them become one body\" (Gen. 2:24). This expression, \"the two of them become one body\" means unity in marriage in the sense of monogamy, as well as in the sense of physical and spiritual unity. This unequivocally monogamous nature of Christian marriage stands in opposition to polygyny. Polygyny is respected by the country's law. In the past it was more associated with the economic and selfdefense requirements of clans; it was also treated as a sign of distinction for men and allowed for marriage contracts to be made with many clans. It was also often brought about by women's infertility, by the advancing age of a first wife, as a means to limit casual sexual relations, as a way of ensuring care for children, and so on. Along with [other] social changes, its nature and ambitions have also decidedly changed; wealth and vanity now take precedence over other motivations, especially in urban areas.  In many cases levirate law has also led to polygyny. This appeared in the Old Testament and was associated with patrilineal social structure based on endogamous tribes. In the case of a deceased brother having a wife, levirate marriage is the same as polygynous marriage and so the same principles are applied to it as are applied to polygynous marriage.  ## 2. The Issue Of Marriage Indissolubility  The indissolubility of marriage, resulting from its divine institution in the Book of Genesis (2:24), was unequivocally repeated by Jesus Christ with the words, \"What God has joined together, no human being must separate\" (Mt.   19:6)20. The Code of Canon Law of the Catholic Church, however, does recognize the existence of obstacles that can either prevent or dissolve marriage. Some of these overlap with traditional Gidar marriage law, as for example impotence on the part of the man. The prohibition of marriage between relatives only partially coincides, because kinship in the Gidar tradition is understood in a very broad sense. The Code of Canon Law, however, does not take into account other traditional obstacles that prevent or dissolve marriage, such as lack of virginity on the part of the bride, or the custom of marrying girls off according to their birth order in the family21. The indissolubility of marriage could also be influenced by lack of children, who were a de facto guarantee of permanence of marriage. The traditional Gidar family did not know childless marriage. A Gidar \"son\" (*utun*)  became a \"man\" (*zile*), when he became a father; a \"daughter\" (*wanke*) became a \"woman\" (*guluk*), when she became a mother22. If it turned out that a young wife was infertile, the husband would return her to her father in exchange for a refund of the marriage fee.  Christian marriage is also decidedly opposed to dissolution of marriage because of failure of the new husband to make full payment of the marriage fee to his father-in-law. All the more so because - as has been mentioned - contemporary changes have led to a specific treating of the marriage fee as an important source of gaining wealth.  Local tradition respected also a man's dismissing his wife for other reasons, as well as the wife leaving the man. If this was the fault of the man, the wife would take the children to her own family and the marriage fee would also remain there. It if was the fault of the wife, the children would remain in the father's compound and he would demand a refund of the marriage fee.  The Christian concept of the indissolubility of marriage, lasting until the death of one of the spouses, is also opposed to the abovementioned levirate tradition. Levirate law stresses that the marriage contract endures even after the death of the man, since it is a contract between clans. Jesus, in answering the Sadducees' question about the fate of marriage after the [final] resurrection of the dead, notes that no one will then marry or be given in marriage, because marriage is strictly connected to earthly existence23. Moreover, it is questionable whether a living brother or another relative should be considered to be acting on behalf of someone who is deceased, in relation to marital duties. Acting on behalf of the deceased, such a substitute is not considered to be the new husband of the woman nor the father of the children of their union, which seriously violates the dignity, unrepeatability, and uniqueness of the human person.  ## 3. The Issue Of Freedom (The Will To Get Married)  In treating marriage as the union of a man and a woman, Christianity emphasizes the necessity that the covenant between them be clearly and freely expressed.   Sometimes in local marriages, the contract was in direct contradiction to freedom and the will to get married - especially in the case of child-brides - and thus violated the very foundations of validity.  The problem of free will in contracting marriage appeared in marriages arranged by the elders of the clan. Also in other cases, pressure from the parents (elders) causes problems with the question of voluntary marriage.  ## 4. The Question Of The Form Of Marriage  The sacramentality of marriage about which the Church speaks, cannot be separated from the marriage contract. If the contract is invalid, then so is the sacrament. For Christ gave marriage a supernatural character, but He did not define its form. Hence it belongs to the Church to define marriage forms.  In the Western Church a form has been developed over centuries based on Roman law: it is the consent of the spouses which decides [contracts] the marriage. In this regard the African bishops posed the question of whether the teaching and practice of the Church, limiting weddings (in the African context) to a single stage of marriage - the exchange of vows by the married couple - was a biblical and universal practice from the anthropological point of view, or was it rather a practice inspired solely by Roman law?24. Th is appears to be an important question because, as Antoine Phillipe - a missionary to the Bambara and author of an extensive study of engagement and marriage - stated years ago: we often unconsciously live in an ethnocentric Church, sometimes connected with a no less real cultural imperialism25.  This manner of contracting marriage was in clear opposition to the local, extensive and multi-stage forms, which in addition emphasized the community dimension of marriage. Consent in traditional marriage was given over stages.   The first of these was the consent of the clans on both sides; the second consent was that of the spouses themselves; the third and fourth, which",

        "sentence_chunk": "confirmed the marriage, were the paying of the marriage fee and the birth of a child. The Christian way of getting married in church (the wedding ceremony) seemed like something incidental, insignificant, not in any way in line with tradition. Some Christians would end up by having two weddings so as to satisfy both local traditions and the requirements of the Church. But these were specific cases.  ## Iii. The Need For Finding An Inculturated Form Of Contracting Marriage  The problem of finding paths of dialogue and solutions between the form of marriage required by the Church and the traditional forms of Sub-Saharan Africa  (including Gidar) has been seen for many years as essential and urgent. This was encouraged by the attitude of John Paul II, who, keeping to his approach of respect and acceptance by the Church of every culture it encounters, at the beginning of the apostolic exhortation *Familiaris Consortio*, confirmed as something fundamental that, \"God's plan for marriage and the family touches men and women in the concreteness of their daily existence in specific social and cultural situations\". And he pointed out the fact that, \"the Church ought to apply herself to understanding the situations within which marriage and the family are living today, in order to fulfill her task of serving\"26. The question of attitude towards local marriage traditions also came up during a meeting of the Episcopal Conference of Africa and Madagascar which took place in 1981 in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon. At that time the bishops of Africa and Madagascar placed the issue of marriage among those that were the \"deepest and most important\" for Africans27.   But despite numerous proposals, no general or continental norms were developed to reconcile the relationship between sacramental marriage and traditional unions. The problem remains unresolved and has often returned during sittings of the Synod of African Bishops. In proposal no. 35, the Synod fathers recommended that all questions related to marriage be analyzed from the theological, sacramental, liturgical, and canonical viewpoints; in particular with reference to cultural issues28.  ## 1. Traditional Marriage Values  In the Gidar marriage process many values, both human and Christian, can be seen. These certainly include the encouragement to premarital chastity; fidelity and a strong disapproval of adultery; an emphasis on indissolubility, which is confirmed by many proverbs and traditions; the relationship between the spouses' families; solidarity; fertility, respect for life, bringing up of children, etc.  ## 2. Expanding The Engagement And Initial Stages  Looking at the multiple stages of Gidar marriage and its extensive preliminary forms (long-term and immediate preparation), it is possible to attempt to link Christian marriage and customary marriage. This can be done during traditional ceremonies, either by the presence of a priest or of those responsible for the Christian community. After the initial discernment, when the boy becomes an agmuk gulku, \"one who has chosen himself a woman\", young people can be accompanied by the Christian community, especially by those of their own age group.   Subsequent rites can be combined with prayer and blessings, crowned with the ubassa rite, that is to say, the official engagement. This stage forms an important part of African heritage. Among the Gidar there are other - already mentioned - stages: ubele, udama i uggla. These stages are essential in order for the young people to be able to discover the values which marriage brings with it, to engage in dialogue together, to open their hearts, and also to take on new responsibilities:  responsible parenthood, raising children, the apostolate, and being open to others. These stages are not associated with premarital sexual relations in either the Gidar or Christian traditions. Both traditions advocate that bodily union should take place only within marriage; moreover, Catholic tradition emphasizes that it should be a sacramental marriage. Chastity - as both a human and Christian virtue - is obligatory during the premarital period and is a preparation for the later, equally important virtue - fidelity.  Since the preliminary stages of Gidar marriage also have a community dimension, these traditions can be continued by proposing that the fianc\u00e9 be accompanied, in addition to parents and friends, by those who are responsible for the local Christian communities. They can also be effectively supported by other Christian couples, who can strengthen them with their testimony and by sharing their Christian experience with them. Days of recollection and retreats, which deepen the Christian dimension and meaning of this commitment, can also help young people in their immediate preparations for marriage.  ## 3. Giving Consent  Looking at the requirements of Western Christian tradition and at Gidar marriage, one might consider inserting these requirements into the uka stage, that is, the \"transferal\" of the girl to the boy's compound, as well as to the *ute glo*, the \"setting up the hearth\" stage. At these stages, African symbols may be introduced in place of wedding rings and only verbal marriage vows. This can be accompanied with the full wealth of formulas, prayers, and readings contained in the Roman Ritual. At this stage the spouses can be accompanied by a priest who represents the hierarchical Church, or if this is a difficulty his representative. Certainly, a difficult problem to solve here is the need to pay the final installment of the matrimonial fee, as is the birth of a child stages of great importance in traditional marriage.  Some theologians, desiring to acknowledge the fullness of the stages in African traditions, no longer speak in their propositions of Christian \"marriage in stages\", but more subtly, distinguish \"different degrees of sacramentality\", recognizing the existence of a single sacramental reality. In their opinion, this is mandated by marital consent (*consensus*) which is increasingly being seen as an act of \"becoming\", and not a simple one-time action. Also, on the theological side, for the validity of marriage, consummation is required, not only an exchange of oaths, treated as a sacramental sign of marriage29.  Certainly, though, the Church, as an \"expert on humanity\", cannot destroy the symbolic dimension of marriage customs. This is not a question of preserving them simply as a form of folklore, as is the case with many liturgical adaptations.   Such adaptations do not answer the problem that the Church faces when encountering custom-based marriage and culture.  ## Summary  In Cameroon we are dealing with three types of marriage: traditional, universally practiced marriage; civil marriage, required by state law before entering into a religious marriage; and, finally, sacramental marriage. Most widespread is the traditional form of contracting marriage. This article will present this particular form, referring to Gidar traditions and also showing its similarities to, and differences from, the Christian tradition brought by the missionaries. It will also propose solutions which combine the two traditions.  A characteristic feature of marriage rites was their multi-stage nature. They were not single acts but events long prepared and celebrated with suitable gestures, symbols, words, and events. The individual, successive stages of \"taking a wife\" consisted of the choice of a spouse, accepted by both families; an engagement period; an act by both families of acknowledgement of the joining of the young persons as one in marriage; the conveying of the bride to her husband's home; celebrating; and paying the matrimonial fee.  The Church in northern Cameroon recognized traditional marriages contracted outside of baptism as valid and licit, provided that local principles, e.g., payment of a marriage fee, were taken into account. If either of the parties accepted baptism, the marriage became for him or her sacramental. If the other party also made the same decision later on, their union took on a sacramental character, without a need to renew the marriage vows. Controversy would however arise if",

All societies have a way of regulating marriage and when a man gets married in a family he is referred to as an in-law. Therefore in-law is a relationship which is established through marriage. To the Beti of Cameroon in particular to be considered as an in-law, a man has certain responsibilities to fulfil among which are the provision of an envelope and food to the family of the woman he wants to marry. Once these are done, he becomes an in-law. The purchase of land among most in not all cultures is very important but the peculiarity among the Beti is that when a man buys land in a Beti locality, he is regarded and treated as an in-law. This article seeks to answer one major question: what is the relationship between a woman and land among the Beti of Cameroon? To establish a relationship between these two (a woman and land), the objectives of this article are to; understand how the Beti people perceive a woman and land; the importance they attach to them and their symbolism. Data for this paper was collected using the qualitative method and the analysis and interpretations are based on the theories of symbolic anthropology of Geertz and functionalism of Malinowski and Brown. Major findings reveal that a woman like land serve as riches, means of production, an element which unites families and many more.  Keywords: Beti of Cameroon, in-law, land, man, marriage and woman Volum 9 Issue 1 - 2024 Exodus Tikere Moffor, Ndjalla Alexandre PhD, The University of Yaounde 1, Cameroon Correspondence: Exodus Tikere Moffor, PhD, The University of Yaounde 1, Cameroon, Email Received: December 18, 2023 | **Published:** January 05, 2024  ## Introduction  This article titled '*man and land: the marriage between a man,*  a woman and land among the Betis of Cameroon', explores the perceptions and importance that the Beti attach to marriage, a man, a woman and land. It also examines the relationship between a woman and land. Marriage is a universal phenomenon but different cultures conduct it differently. Among the Beti like in most parts of Africa, when a man marries a woman, he has to pay bride price and provide food to the family of the woman for the woman to be officially transferred from her own family to that of the man. Henceforth the man is considered and treated as an in-law by the woman's or wife's family. When a man purchases a piece of land in the Beti locality, he has to provide the fee charged for the land including food to the family that is selling the land. These items provided permits the officially transfer of the land to the buyer. Henceforth, the buyer of the land is considered and treated as an in-law by the family that sold the land.   The Beti people are a Central African ethnic group primarily found in central Cameroon, in the cultural zone of Cameroon called Fang-Beti. They are also found in Equatorial Guinea and northern Gabon. They are closely related to the Bulu, the Fang and the Ewondo (Yaunde) people, who are all sometimes grouped as Ekang. That is, the Beti consists of the Ewondo (more precisely Kolo), Bane, Fang (more precisely M'fang), and Eton or Iton.  The Beti people migrated south and west from the Sanaga River basin into equatorial forests regions. They are Bantu people who once lived in northern parts of Central Africa, with a complex, undocumented and debated prehistory. They likely moved into equatorial Africa in the 7th or 8th century, then further southwest in central Cameroon between the 17th and 19th centuries, likely after waves of wars and slave raids from the Fulani people. They were also a targeted source for slaves and ivory by the Hausa people.  Their initial migration in the 17th century was from highlands and forested regions east of the Sanaga River towards south and west. They continued to face jihads and violence from the north by the Fulani people (also called Fulbe or Fula people), abandoned their settlements and migrated further into southern parts of central Cameroon till the 19th century when European traders and colonial forces intervened as they sought trade and markets (en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beti people).   One of the economic activities of the Beti people is farming. These people especially those living in the country site are actively engaged in farming growing crops (like cassava, maize, yams, cocoa, plantain, banana and many more) and also keeping animals such as pigs and chickens. These crops cultivated are used for both commercial as well as domestic purposes. Every Beti man is expected to own a farm. For this reason, a Beti man is rated on the size of his farm. A man who does not have a farm let alone owning a piece of land is not respected among his peers and the society.  ## Methods And Materials  The methods that the researchers used in the research study was done under the following aspects: study design, selection of research participants, data collection, data collection tools and procedure and data analysis.  ## Study Design  The researchers used the narrative study design. Like Bowling1 notes narrative design allows the participants of the study to share their knowledge on a particular topic. The study design guides the collection of rich data and the use of methods of analysis that will achieve the research objectives.2  ## Selection Of Research Participants  We used the snowball sampling method to select participants for the study. Snowball sampling is a non-probability sampling method where new participants are recruited by other participants to take part in a research study. It begins with one or more study participants and then continues on the basis of references from these participants. The   ## Presentation Of Findings And Discussion  process continues until the researcher reaches the desired sample of a saturation point. The snowball sampling technique was to ensure that a wide range of the study topic was covered.   ## Data Collection  Data for the study was collected using participant observation, indepth interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs). The researchers participated in the buying of land and in a few traditional marriages. As concerns the purchase of land, emphases was laid on the different rites conducted after a piece of land was bought particularly that performed by the chief or *Nkunkuma* of the locality. During traditional marriages, the researchers observed the varied items brought for the marriage, the rites conducted and how food for the marriage was shared among the family members. In-depth interviews were conducted with married people both male and female and those who have sold and bought land. These were face to face interviews with the use of openended unstructured questions. 12 married people were interviewed meanwhile 11 interviews were conducted with 6 sellers and 5 buyers of land in the Beti communities. This technique was employed to understand how the Beti people perceive marriage, a man, woman and land. It was equally used to comprehend the relationship between a woman and land. 7 FGDs were conducted, 4 with married people and 3 with individuals who have sold and bought land. Each FGD was made up of between 7 and 10 participants. The FGDs were meant to examine the perceptions of a woman and land to the Beti. This was in an attempt to establish a relationship between a woman and land.   ## Data Collection Tools And Procedure  The researchers used the interview guides and focus group discussion guides respectively to collect data for the study. Among the questions that featured on the guides were the perceptions of marriage, man, woman and land; the role of a woman and land in the Beti communities; rites performed during traditional marriages; rites conducted during and after the buying of land; and the relationship between the woman and land among the Beti.   In the course of the interviews, the researchers took detail notes in their exercise books. Most of these interviews were",

Many of the interviews lasted for about an hour meanwhile the focus group discussions went for about an hour and more.   ## Data Analysis  Data was analysed soon after data collection. Data which was audio-taped using a digital voice recorder was replayed many times and then transcribed verbatim into Microsoft word. The data was read, coded, clustered and then sub-themes and themes were developed.  together with the functions of each. Here, we made use of the theory of functionalism of anthropologists Radcliff-Brown and Malinowski, which represents two strands in the theory: structural functionalism, which stresses the pre-eminence of society and its structure over the individuals, and how the various elements of the social structure function to maintain social order and equilibrium; and psychological functionalism, which stresses individual needs to be met by society. In this respect, the authors made an attempt to demonstrate the functions of marriage, man, woman and land. The paragraphs which follow, handle the perceptions of these four concepts and their functions.   ## /Aluk/ Marriage And How The Beti Perceive It  Aluk or Marriage is defined as basically a sexual union between a man and a woman such that children born to the woman are considered the legitimate offspring of both parents. The main purpose of marriage is to create new social relationships, rights and obligations between the spouses and their kin, and to establish the rights and status of children when they are born.3 Mbiti4 regards marriage as \"a rhythm of life in which everyone must participate\". Going by Mbiti's, definition, among the Beti, in marriage, the couple have to contribute for its success. That is, each member has to perform his or her role well, the man, a provider and protector meanwhile the woman, the administrator, teacher and manager of the household. In the Beti societies, marriage is often more of a relationship between groups than one between individuals. An interlocutor, a Beti man said that:  \"Most times, people may think that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. This is not the case with the Betis. For two persons, man and a woman to get married, the two families must accept that their children should be brought together by this union. When the two families agree, they will all pour their blessing on the couple\" (18/11/2023).   ## Another Beti Man Notes That:  \"Marriage is a sacred union between two clans, it is something grandiose. It is a union between two clans because the Beti practise exogamous marriage, meaning that a man must marry out of his clan. Marriage shows success in the family of the woman and responsibility in the family of the man. It is success to the woman's family because it demonstrates that the family is a good one, that has succeeded to train their daughter well and that the family does not have records of evil, murderers, thieves and more. To the man's family, it is responsibility because the man and his family must do everything to take proper care of the woman and once married, the woman shall be referred to as 'our wife' that means the wife of the family. Responsibility also means that the man shall respect his wife and never be violent to her. There are certain men that once married, they turn their wives into punching balls, and this is not a sign of responsibility\" (20/09/2023).   In the Beti societies like in all African societies, a man can only married when he has fulfilled all the payments and proper rites conducted. For a man to get married therefore, his family has to visit that of the women he wishes to marry and collect a list of items which are needed for the ceremony. A list here, refers to all the goods which the man and his family has to provide to the family of the woman. As they pay this visit, they carry along some symbolic items like 10 litres of red wine, a goat, and some beer. It is important to mention that the length of the list differs according to families. No matter the family some of the items on the list are, palm wine, red wine, goats, pigs, colanut, fish and much more. When a man collects the list and comes back, it shows that he is actually serious in marrying the woman. If he goes and does not return, it shows that he is irresponsible and does not love the woman. An elderly Beti man said:  Among the Beti of Cameroon, the word in-law is used to refer to someone who gets married in a family and also to somebody who buys land from a family. Considering the fact that in-law is a relation by marriage, the researchers sought to examine how the woman and land are related. Before that they carried out a finding on how the Beti people perceive marriage, a man, a woman and land.   ## Perceptions Of Marriage, Man, Woman And Land  To understand the relationships which exist between a woman and land, we have to first of all understand how the Beti people perceive marriage, man, woman and land. The perceptions here are examined Citation: Moffor ET, Alexandre N. Man and land: The marriage between a man, a woman and land among the Beti of Cameroon. *J His Arch & Anthropol Sci.*  2024;9(1):1\u20129. DOI: 10.15406/jhaas.2024.09.00293 3   \"Many people may think that the list that our people (Beti people)  give is long. The list which is given is negotiable. When I wanted to marry my wife, I was given a long list of items to provide. I went and came back and told the parents of my, to be wife, that the list was long, I begged them and the list was reduced. Because I came back, they saw that I was serous, I love their daughter and this was a sign that I could take care of her\" (15/11/2023).  When a man wants to get married, he has to show prove to the family of the woman that he can take care of their daughter. Bride price is therefore a test which is given to a man to find out whether or not he can take proper care of a woman, that their daughter will be in good hands. Bride price is also a symbolic offering of a gift in order to obtain a woman. Accepting to pay the bride price of a woman is a demonstration of the love that a boy has for a girl (20/09/2023).  Apart from the list, an envelope which represents bride price is given to the family of the woman. Bride price is a sum of money or other valuables paid by the bridegroom or on his behalf to the family of the bride. Bride price is marriage payment made to the bride and/ or her group, in terms of money and material gifts by the bride groom. Concerning bride price, an interlocutor said: \"Bride price is a symbolic gift to thank the parents of a woman.   The family of the man will ask that of the woman what they want in exchange of their daughter. This exchange is not an exchange in the commercial sense where a man may give an amount of money and collect a good. In this case, the exchange is one of friendship and love. Bride price therefore is a gift which honours the future wife of a man\" (19/09/2023).  According to en.wikibooks.org., Cultural Anthropology (2013)  bride wealth is the transfer of symbolic goods from the husband's family to the bride's family. This form of economic exchange is most often found in agricultural and pastoral patrilinealsocieties, though it is not limited to those lifestyles. Usually, bride wealth represents some form of compensation to the bride's family from the husband's family, for their loss of her labour and ability to bear them children. This is because when a woman marries, she goes to live, produce children, and work with her husband's family, leaving her own. In many cases, bride wealth also serves to create a positive relationship between the families of the husband and wife. When the wife's family receives the bride wealth, they use the goods they receive for their daughter to find her brother a wife. Some examples of the goods which are exchanged in regards to bride wealth are: animals, such as cattle or goats, in east and South Africa and a bride wealth of cash in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

        "sentence_chunk": "as an adult male human being; a man or boy shows the qualities (such as strength and courage) that men are traditionally supposed to have. To the Betis, a man is the head or chief of his family. And as head, he has to ensure the protection of his wife and child or children from danger. An interlocutor, a Beti woman said in an interview that:  \"One of the main responsibilities of a man is that he is as head of the family unit. The man is expected to serve as the spokesperson for his family and make some of the major decisions on behalf of the family. He decides on the residence of the family, the children bear his name and when a man marries a wife, the latter adopts the husband's family name\" (18/11/2013).  A man to the Beti is someone who has a wife and a child or children. Commenting on this, an informant said: \"When a man is not married and does not have children no matter his age, he is not regarded as a 'real' man, he is a member of his father's family and cannot take any decision in this family. A man has to be physically strong and hard working as opposed to weak and emotional. A real man is one who protects and defends the integrity of his family. He should be known for defending them strongly and sticking to his opinions no matter what\" (15/11/2023).   Among the Beti, the strength of a man is rated from the size of his farmland. It could be a plantain, banana, cassava, maize, yam or even cocoa farm. Most men prefer the cultivation of cocoa because it is a cash crop which produces income for many year since it is a perennial crop. A man does this because he wants to be self-reliant, stand on his own and not need to depend on others for his wellbeing. A man who does not own such a farm is not respected in the society and he is regarded like someone who is not married. An elderly Beti man said:  \"A man must be someone who is very strong to fend for as well as protect his family and this can be seen in the type of farm which he owns. If he owns a large farm, it is an indication that he will work hard to maintain the farm, the food from the farm will sustain the family and the money which he will make from the sales of crops will help in the up keep of the family\" (17/11/2023).  Having the title of \"man\" comes with particular responsibilities, and how a man fulfils those responsibilities defines his identity. As a man, he has the duties to protect, guide, treat, educate, provide, as well as procreate. A man's development through the stages of manhood is unquestionably marked by the need to protect himself and those around him. When it comes to protecting something, a man must be both physically and mentally strong. That is, a man has to protect his family from harm. He is the one who stands up and fights for his family if necessary. There will be times when he has to put his family first. As the defender of his family, he has to be courageous, capable of demonstrating fearlessness in the face of danger. It is up to him to ensure that his home is safe from internal and external threats. A man who is fearful stands the chance of exposing his family and such a man is regarded as a woman among the Beti.  The man is always the strong one, who does the heaviest work for his family, he supports the family in financing, building the house or providing settlement. The man provides for the education of his children by sending them to school, paying for their education, buying all their school needs like uniforms, and writing materials. The man buys dresses for the wife as well as the children. He equally has to provide food for the family. He has to work extremely hard to ensure that the wife and children do not go hungry. A man therefore is that individual who takes care, ensures food, financial and physical security of his family. An elderly Beti woman said:  \"The responsibilities of a man is reflected in his wife and children.   If his wife and children are always shabby, or they behave poorly, this will be attributed to the man. On the contrary, if they look good and behave well as well as succeed in school and in life, it will be said that the man has succeeded\" (20/09/2023).   According to Steven (Https://Warofmen.Com/Author/Steven/), the role of a man in life is to be a provider and protector. A man is the head of the household and is responsible for making sure that his family has what they need to live a comfortable life. A husband and father play an essential role in a family. They are responsible for providing for the family financially and emotionally. Those times when he used to date multiple women are now in the past now that he is a one-woman man. His priorities have changed, and he now has a family to think about. His wife is his best friend and confidante. She is the one person who Citation: Moffor ET, Alexandre N. Man and land: The marriage between a man, a woman and land among the Beti of Cameroon. *J His Arch & Anthropol Sci.*  2024;9(1):1\u20129. DOI: 10.15406/jhaas.2024.09.00293 4 knows him better than anyone else. So he needs to be there for her when she needs you.  The man teaches the culture of the society to the children. For instance if the man is a farmer, he takes his child or children to the farm frequently so as to participant in crops cultivation. These children will keep such practice as they grows up. They will spread this practice to the next generation, when they start having family of their own. An informant said:  \"The man has to educate the children in his culture. When I was growing up, my father usually gathered us in the evenings and told us stories about the history of his people, taught us some folk stories, riddles and jokes and sometimes some folk songs. This was how I like my siblings learned some aspects of our culture\" (17/11/2023).   A man should balance between his family and his job. Sometimes, a man can be very busy looking for finances for the family, thus forgetting his duty as a father, neglecting his responsibility of teaching the children. As a father, a man has the responsibility to teach his children the skills needed to become good and successful people in life. His children are his life. They are innocent and need his guidance to grow into responsible adults. He shows them what it means to be a good husband and father. He also elevates his family on all levels by leading by example in all areas of life. He is someone who puts his family first. His number one priority is making sure that his wife and children are happy and safe. He makes time for his wife and kids. This means being involved in their lives and taking an interest in what is going on with them. It also means being there for them when they need him. Being present, listening to them and offering advice when they are going through tough times. Being present physically and emotionally for his family is one of the most important things he can do as a man.   The man is expected to serve as a role model for the younger boys.   The advancement of human society is dependent on the passing on of traditions and skills from one generation to the other. Men are expected to teach some of the \"manly\" things to their sons. This means being someone they can look up to and admire. Young men need guidance and direction in their lives. They need to see that it is possible to be a man and still be a good husband and father. If you want his son to grow up as a man of character, he need to be one himself. For a girl, the father is usually taken as the model for her future life partner.   Women provide that one thing that will make a man fall deeply in love with her and can keep him happy for a lifetime. Good sex is an integral part of a man's life. It is a way to connect with his partner physically and emotionally. It is also a way to release stress and tension. A good sexual relationship can be the glue that holds a relationship together. Sex in the relationship is equally for procreation. According to the Beti like most African cultures, a man's value is measured in the number of children he has. If a man does not have a child, if he is not married, he is regarded as an irresponsible man, and a disgrace to his family, a disgrace because the",

        "sentence_chunk": "society would say that the family has failed and if the man happens to die, he will neither leave behind someone to remember him nor continue with his name. Because of the importance the Beti people place on procreation, if a family has a brother of about 40 years of age who is not married and does not have a child, an interlocutor said:  \"The family of a man could come together and marry a wife for their son because they understand that once a man has a wife and subsequently a child or children, he will be respected, he could be able to speak where others are speaking. He will be considered a successful man. Because of the responsibility he has, he must do everything to take good care of his family, that is, he has to work very hard to meet their needs\" (16/11/2023).   Regarding who a man is, Baloyi5 quoting Harrington6 notes that in many African societies, boys undergo initiation stages where education about manhood is imparted by elderly men, some of whom are regarded as custodians of culture in society. Both masculinity and manhood are accepted by most African men as part of cultural values which men should have. Therefore, a man who shows his emotions is usually regarded as weak and not part of the larger group of real African men. This adds to the idea that toughness is equated with maleness while emotions and align with femaleness. This becomes a way of seeing aggression in a sense of masculinity traits where other people, particularly women, no longer feel safe.6 Barker and Ricardo7 give a different angle of what makes an ideal Africa man, apart from the training he receives from the initiation schools, they point out that:  \"The chief mandate or social requirement for achieving manhood in Africa - for being a man - is achieving some level of financial independence, employment or income, and subsequently starting a family. In much of Africa - where bride-price is commonplace - marriage and family formation are thus directly tied to having income and/or property.\"  Indeed, in a context where a man does not have an income to support his family, his masculinity and manhood are threatened not only in his home but also among his peers in society. Barker and Ricardo7 show that masculinity and manhood are injected by many factors that make a man feel strong and in control. In these sociological constructs of masculinity and manhood ideologies, there exists a culture infused into African believers that it is right for men to be aggressive. These are ideologies which have influenced and shaped society for centuries and are still in existence.   ## /Min'Nga/ A Woman, How The Beti Perceive Her  A woman is an adult female human being. A woman is an individual who was assigned female at birth and has maintained that status until today (source). *Min'nga* is the word for a woman. Min which means swallow and nga stands for a gun. Therefore *min'nga* literarily means that which *swallows* the gun. A woman may be termed that which swallows the gun because she receives the penis of the man which is regarded as a gun. This gun is symbolic because it is not used to kill but to procreate. The 'gun' or penis of a man must be available for a woman to give birth to a child and a woman who is able to procreate is not regarded as a woman and as such will not be respected among her in-laws, peers and society at large.   ## According To An Interlocutor, A Woman To The Beti Is:  \"The companion of a man. A woman accompanies a man to become the head of the family, without a woman and if a woman does give a child or children to a man, that man can never form a family. A woman is also considered to be a female who can already see her menses. When a girl sees her menses, it means that she can bear children, thus she can get married. A girl who sees her menses by the age of 12, is considered early because a girl should see her menses from 15 years. Therefore when a girl can see her menses, she can be prepared by her parents to understand that one day she has to get married and become a woman\" (19/11/2023).   ## Another Beti Man Said That A Woman Is:  \"Not only our mother, she is a symbol of great riches. The Beti believe that when a man marries a woman, she is expected to give birth Citation: Moffor ET, Alexandre N. Man and land: The marriage between a man, a woman and land among the Beti of Cameroon. *J His Arch & Anthropol Sci.*  2024;9(1):1\u20129.

She is thus responsible for the maintenance of utmost discipline in the family.  As a mother she is the family health officer. She is very much concerned about the physical wellbeing of every member of the family, the helpless infant, the sickly child, the adolescent youth, and senescent parent. She organizes the home and its activities in such a way so that each member of the family has proper food, adequate sleep and sufficient recreation. She makes the home a place of quite comfortable and appropriate setting for the children through her talent. Besides, she cultivates taste in interior design and arrangement, so that the home becomes an inviting, restful and cheerful place.  The mother is the central personality of the home and the family circle. All the members turn to her for sympathy, understanding and recognition. The woman devotes her time, labour and thought for the welfare of the members of the family. For the unity of interacting personalities, man provides the temple woman provides the ceremonies and the atmosphere.  She is the first teacher of the child. She transmits social heritage to the child. It is from mother that the child learns the laws of the race, the manner of men, moral code and ideals. The mother, because of her intimate and sustained contact with the child, she is able to discover and nurture child's special traits aptitudes and attitudes which subsequently play a key role in the shaping of his or her personality.  The woman performs the role of wife, partner, organiser, administrator, director, re-creator, disburser, economist, mother, disciplinarian, teacher, health officer, artist and queen in the family at the same time. Apart from it, the woman plays a key role in the socioeconomic development of the society.  to many children among whom are girl children. These girl children will be given out into marriage and the bride price is a form of riches. The many children also bring fame to the family\" (16/11/2023).  ## An Interlocutor Noted In A Focus Group Discussion That:  \"A woman is that person who is hard working, resistant and caring. The Beti people do not know laziness. A woman works hard especially the rural woman. She accompanies her husband to the farm where most times she works all day long and only returns in the evening. It is very common to find a Beti woman in areas like Nouma, Nkoulnkoumou, Ndzana and many more in the morning carrying a basket containing her machete and hoe on her way to the farm. When she finishes to work on the farm she collects food stuffs such as cassava, yams, cocoyams, or whatever food item available in the farm.

Women have diverse roles and (https:www.yourariclelibrary.  com/family/role-of-women-in-the-family-and-society/) notes that: Women are the pioneers of nation. They are the key to sustainable development and quality of life in the family. The varieties of role the women assume in the family are those of wife, leader, administrator, manager of family income and last but not the least important the mother.  The woman is a wife, that is, a man's partner and comrade. She sacrifices her personal pleasure and ambitions, sets standard of morality, relieves stress and strain, tension of husband, and maintains peace and order in the household. Thereby she creates necessary environment for her male partner to think more about the economic upliftment of family.

The woman is an administrator and leader of the household.   A well-ordered disciplined household is essential to normal family life. The woman in the family assumes this function. She is the chief executive of an enterprise. She assigns duties among family members according to their interest and abilities and provides resources in-term of equipment and materials to accomplish the job.  She plays a key role in the preparation and serving of meals, selection and care of clothing, laundering, furnishing and maintenance of the house. As an administrator, she organises various social functions in the family for social development. She also acts as a director of recreation. She plans various recreational activities to meet the needs of young and old members of the family.  The woman acts as the humble manager of the family income.   It is her responsibility to secure maximum return from every pye spent. She always prefers to prepare a surplus budget instead of a deficit budget. She is very calculating loss and gain while spending money. She distributes judiciously the income on different heads such as necessities, comforts and luxuries. The woman in the family also contributes to the family income through her own earning within or outside the home. She has positive contribution to the family income by the work.

Land can include anything that's on the ground, which means that buildings, trees, and water that are a part of land are an asset. The term land encompasses all physical elements, bestowed by nature, to a specific area or piece of property - the environment, fields, forests, minerals, climate, animals, and bodies or sources of water. The basic concept of land is that it is a specific piece of earth, a property with clearly delineated boundaries that has an owner. The concept of land can be viewed in different ways, depending on its context, and the circumstances under which it is being analysed.  Saimum, 9 notes that in a general sense, land means the solid portion of the earth's surface. The word \"land\" includes not only the soil, but everything attached to it, whether attached by the course of nature, as trees, herbage, and water, or by the hand of man, as buildings and fences. Land is the solid material of the earth, whatever may be the ingredients of which it is composed, whether soil, rock, or other substance.  According to Encyclopaedia Britannica, land in economics is the natural resource used in production. In classical economics, the three factors of production are land, labour, and capital. Land was considered to be the \"original and inexhaustible gift of nature.\" In modern economics, it is broadly defined to include all that nature provides, including minerals, forest products, and water and land resources. While many of these are renewable resources, no one considers them \"inexhaustible.\" Citation: Moffor ET, Alexandre N. Man and land: The marriage between a man, a woman and land among the Beti of Cameroon. *J His Arch & Anthropol Sci.*  2024;9(1):1\u20129. DOI: 10.15406/jhaas.2024.09.00293 6 Owning land is important because it is a source of wealth. Land can be harvested and the materials grown on it sold for profit. Factories, warehouses, and buildings can be built on land that will facilitate business. Land can be leased in return for income. Land is also a tangible good that does not depreciate. In addition, land cannot easily be tampered with, in that there is nothing to steal from it. It can be polluted, but that can also be prevented to a degree.  Land according to a Beti man is a treasure that nature has given to each community. With such treasure, a Beti man knows that he has to 'dig' or exploit it to have a treasure. Land therefore symbolises riches. A Beti interlocutor notes that:  \"Someone who has landed property is a rich man, because he can open a farm (where he will grow crops or keep animals) on it, he can build a house on it, and he can also carry out other businesses on land. A man who does not have land is regarded as a poor man in the society. If a man does not have land where will he construct his home, when he gets married where will he keep his wife? If it happens that a man marries and does not have a home of his, he can live in his father's compound with the intention that the following year he will do everything possible to construct a house. In order to build a house, he must first of all possess a piece of land if the family does not have land for him to build his house on. Some people prefer to build a home first before getting married and then start a family\" (19/09/2023).  ## Another Man Of The Beti Origin Said That:  \"Land is an asset acquired by a man or woman through the death of a parent, brother, sister, aunt or uncle (who was unable to have children). In this way, the Beti consider their land to be a source of great wealth. Among the Betis, when someone does not own land, he's considered the poorest of his community, because he is perceived as a beggar for plots of land to cultivate. The management of the land is not determined by the bigger but by the owner. That is, the owner of the land will ask the beggar not to plant perennial crops like plantain, banana or cocoa among others, because these perennial crops will make the beggar not to leave due to the nature of his crops. Again, when a member of the community does not own any land, he or she is perceived as a slave because he or she will always walk behind those who have large plots of land (like an errand boy who is told to do this and that) with the hope of getting a few square meters to build a house or start a small farm\" (16/11/2023).  Land has varied uses. Different types of land could be used for different purposes. How land is used can change as human habits, population change, and people move. Generally speaking, there are six main types of land use or categories for which humans use land. These include agriculture, residents, commerce, recreation, industry and transportation. Most Beti and non-Beti people in the suburbs and in the villages are engaged in agriculture. They use the land they possess to grow crops and keep animals such as pigs, goats and chickens. As concerns the farming of crops, the most cultivated crops include cassava, yams, maize, plantains, bananas and cocoa. There are people who own hectares upon hectares of cocoa and cassava farms. Other people are specialised in animal husbandry, keeping larger numbers of chickens and pigs. These animals are purposely for commercialisation. The farms be they crops cultivation or animals keeping generate huge income for their owners.   Some of the people use their land to build residents. These residents may compress the house of the land owner. Once he has his residence constructed, he no longer pays rents for a house. An interlocutor in an interview said:  \"Ever since I build my house, I do not have anything to worry about especially when I have to pay rents at the end of each month. A  man who lives on rents and cannot afford his rents on time runs the risk of being thrown out of the house at any time. Where I was living before building my residence, I did not have enough space, but I have built my house to my taste and I have enough space for my children to play\" (19/11/2023).  Other people choose to construct apartments where they put on rents. These apartments could be rented by people for their offices, as well as for residences. Some of the apartments could be hired by",

Therefore such houses or apartments constructed on land generates much money for their owners and will do so for a very long time.   There are yet other people who use their land to build a clinics and hospital, a school, shops and supermarkets. Land used for the construction of a school must be large enough to contain classrooms and play grounds for the learners. Such school may range from day care to high school.   Land could also be rented out to people to open farms and do other businesses. Land is usually rented out to farmers to cultivate seasonal as well as perennial crops. Some people may rent to grow maize, cassava, yams among others. Payment on land for the growing of the above mention crops is done yearly, before the cultivation is done. To start a farm like that of a cocoa plantation, the land owner may come into an agreement with the farmer either to pay the rents in cash of in 'two party'. Two party is a type of arrangement where the farmer divides the proceeds from the cocoa farm between the land owner and himself.   ## The Relationship Between A Woman And Land  This portion of the article is interpreted using Geertz theory of symbolic anthropology. Geertz championed symbolic anthropology in the 1930s and 1940s. This theory focuses on the symbolic rather than material aspect of culture. It is the study of culture through the interpretation of the meaning of symbols, values and beliefs in society. Among the Beti of Cameroon, when a man marries a woman in a family, he is called and treated as an in-law. This is same with someone who buys land in these communities. There is therefore a relationship between a woman and land. Some of them include that fact that; a woman like land serve for production, a man is considered a man when he marries a woman and owns landed property, a man who marries a woman or buys a piece of land must take care of them, a woman like land unit families, they create a new social relationship between families, food is provided after the payment of bride price and money for the land respectively.   A woman as well as land serve for production. One of the most important roles of the woman is procreation. When a Beti man like all other African gets married, him and his family awards the 'cry' or birth of a baby. This shows that a child is very important in African societies in general and among the Betis in particular. The birth is not only a source of joy for the family and society but also an additional member of the family and society. Commenting on child birth in African societies, Mbiti,4 notes that: \"Children are the buds of society, and every birth is the arrival of  'spring' when life shoots out and the community thrives. The birth of a child is, therefore, the concern not only of the persons but of many relatives including the living and the departed\" (p. 110).   A woman serve for the production or reproduction of new members of the society. According to the Encyclopaedia of Anthropology, human reproduction refers to \"the process by which new social Citation: Moffor ET, Alexandre N. Man and land: The marriage between a man, a woman and land among the Beti of Cameroon. *J His Arch & Anthropol Sci.*  2024;9(1):1\u20129. DOI: 10.15406/jhaas.2024.09.00293 7 members are produced specifically, the physiological process of conception, pregnancy, birth, and child raising. From a larger prospective, reproduction is what makes a whole society continue to thrive without becoming extinct (http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/ Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf.). (p. 376) Due to the importance of a child, among the Beti, everyone is expected to get married and have a child or children. A woman who gets married and does not have a child will not find favour from her in-laws in the marriage. She will sometime be treated as an object which does not have any 'use' because she is unable to fulfil her fundamental role of production. Because of her failure to produce, the mother of the man may force him to get married to another woman. Because she like the other members of the family fear that their brother and son should not die without having someone to remember him as Mbiti (1969) notes:  \"If you do not get married and have children, who will pour out libation to you when you die? This is a serious philosophical concern among traditional African people. Unfortunate, therefore, is the man or woman who has nobody to 'remember' him (her), after physical death. To lack someone close who keeps the departed in their personal immortality is the worse misfortune and punishment that any person could suffer. To die without getting married and without children is to be completely cut off from the human society, to become disconnected, to become an outcast and so lose all links with mankind. Everybody, therefore, must get married and bear children that is the greatest hope and expectation of the individual for himself and of the community for the individual\" (p. 134).  Land also serve for production but not like the woman. When a man buys a piece of land and build his house on it, this house generates income for him because the amount of money which he or she would have been spending on rents could be saved. Some people buy land to build houses for different businesses. Some may choose to build a schools, others hospitals, and yet others supermarkets. These are all businesses which do not only serve to generate much money for their owners but provide social services to the society.   Land is very important to the people because it serves as a means of livelihood. A lot of people civil servants and non-civil servants alike own large farms on which the cultivate crops. These crops especially maize is sold to companies which produce breweries, cassava sold to producers of garri and cocoa sold in kilograms to cocoa cooperatives. Cocoa cooperatives are associations which collect cocoa beans from the farmers. The crops cultivated bring in a lot of income to the owners.   A man is considered a man among the Beti when he is married and when he owns landed property. Marrying a woman means that a young man has grown enough and is ready to start his own family. The people think that responsibility begins when a man is married. And when a man is married, he has the duty to take care of his wife by making her comfortable; providing her with her basic necessities, providing money for the up keep of the house and more. As he takes care of his wife, he also comes to the aid of some of the relatives of his wife. His doors have to be open to the brothers, sisters, uncles and the aunts of his wife as well. Failure to respect his in-laws, he will be regarded as a bad son in-law. An elderly Beti man said:  \"A man according to the Betis is someone who is married and has children. A man no mater his age, if he does not have a wife and not married, he can never earn any respect in his family and society. If a man is not married, he is considered as a member of his father's family since he does not yet have his own family. On the contrary, if someone is married and has children, he becomes the head of his family\" (10/11/2023).   Marriage is very important because it demonstrates the capacity of a man to raise money (bride price) and food required to married a wife. Someone who is able to provide the bride price and food to marry a woman is prove of love and that he could take good care of the wife and children. Marriage is the beginning of the family because when a child is born in the family, it is one of the greatest blessings. This explains why the birth of a child is usually welcome with a lot of merry making.   When the marriage rites are conducted, the father or the head of the woman's family gives palm wine in a cup to 'show' or hand to her would be husband in public. In the Cameroon Grassfields, the cup used in this rite is either the horn of the cow for a simple family head and a sculpted buffalo horn in case where the family head is a notable. when the husband is identified, the head of the family therefore offers some words of blessings and prayers in which he",

        "sentence_chunk": "thanks the ancestors and gods for the occasion, ask for prosperity, love among the couple, protection, guidance and above all that the union be blessed with many children. The ancestors are implicated in these rites because the Beti people like most Africans belief that they (ancestors) are always there watching and taking care of the living. They must therefore be informed and called upon to take control of everything.   As concerns land ownership, a true Beti man is one who has a piece of land, a piece of land which will serve to grow crops as well as build the family home. If a man gets married and does not have land to build his house, he will either live in the family home or rents a house. If he is married and continues to live in his father's compound with his wife, he will not have respect especially if the compound is small to accommodate everyone in the family. He or his wife may have problems with his brothers or sisters.   A man who marries a woman or buys a piece of land must take care of them. When a man is married to a woman, he has a responsibility to protect his family. Educate the family, and provide for the needs of the family. The wife on her part is the husband's companion, she has to accompany her husband in all the projects which he has to carry. If the man is engaged in the construction of a house for instance, his wife has to support him in this venture. The wife also has to accompany her husband in educating the children. As she caters for the children, she reports everything that happens to a child or children to her husband. If a child is ill for instance, she tells her husband who will either take the sick child to the hospital or buy medications for him or her. Because the wife is his companion, her husband has the obligation to watch over her. But if her husband fails to watch over her, she may be deceived by someone else who shows concern for her by treating her nicely.   He makes time for his wife and kids as discussed earlier. This means that he has to be involved in their lives and taking an interest in what is going on with them. It also means being there for them when they need him. Being present, listening to them and offering advice when they are going through tough times. Being present physically and emotionally for his family is one of the most important things he can do as a man. When he does all these, he will earn a lot of love and respect from his wife and children and this will make his family stronger. By so doing, no one can come between them (husband and wife).  Just like a women who has to be taken care of in marriage, when a man buys a piece of land, he has the obligation to watch over the land by may be farming it (planting both seasonal and perennial crops) if Citation: Moffor ET, Alexandre N. Man and land: The marriage between a man, a woman and land among the Beti of Cameroon. *J His Arch & Anthropol Sci.*  2024;9(1):1\u20129. DOI: 10.15406/jhaas.2024.09.00293 8 he does not have enough financial resources to build a house or carry out some other project on it. Often times, sellers of land will tell their buyers when all payments and rituals have been done on a piece of land that: \"from now hence this land is yours, you have to take care of it, protect it. I am no longer there so if something happens to it do not ask me because I am not the one to watch over it\" (14/11/2023). This means that if a buys land and does not take of it, another individual may snatch it. The researchers have heard of many cases where the land of some individuals have been snatched by others or the seller of the land on the pretext that there was no one occupying it.   A Woman like Land Units Families. When a man takes as wife or marries a Beti woman, he is called an in-law or more precisely son in-law. An in-law is someone who is a relative because of marriage. When a man marries a Beti woman, he symbolically becomes a part of the woman's family. This means that any ceremony in his wife's family be it happy or sad, he has to take active part in it. Among the Grassfielders of Cameroon, when the father or mother of an in-law dies, the in-law or in-laws (if there are many men who are married to that family) he or they have the responsibility to provide the coffin in which the corpse has to be put. He or each of the in-laws has to have his own 'die house' that is, a house to receive visitors in the ceremony.   Like a woman, when a man be he an indigene or not buys land from a Beti man, the buyer of the land is considered and called an in-law. He or she performs all the different rites like someone who is married in a family. A buyer of a piece of land is regarded and treated as a member of that family. Being a member means that the in-law contributes in all events but he cannot take any major decision so far as the family's affairs are concerned.   Marriage as well as land purchase create a new social relationship between both families. This means that because of any of the above acts (buying of land or marrying of a woman), the family of the man who buys land and that of the seller, the family of the bride and that of the groom always come to each other's aid when need arises. An interlocutor, a Beti man said in an interview that: \"I have given out my daughters' hands in marriage to three men.   The families of these men who are married to my daughters are already part of my family, we have become one large family. This is in the sense that when I have any celebration in my compound, I inform each of these families. Each will honour my invitation by giving me gifts. And if any of these families married to my daughters equally have an occasion, I am inform and I in turn offer that family a gift\" (20/11/2023).  ## Another Elderly Man Of The Eton Origin Said:  \"I own a large piece of land which was given to me by my father. I  have sold a portion of it. My family and I consider and treat the buyer of the land as an in-law. Whenever I have a ceremony I inform him and whenever he has one, he also informs me. In every occasion, we offer gift either in kind or cash to one another\" (10/10/2023).   This gifts exchange mirrors Mauss gift and counter gift. Mauss  (1923) comments that because gifts are inalienable they must be returned: the act of giving creates a gift-debt that has to be repaid. He argues that gifts are never \"free.\" Rather, he noted that human history is full of examples that gifts give rise to reciprocal exchange. To him, gift entails three obligations: to give, to receive, and to reciprocate. Each gift is \"part of a system of reciprocity in which the honour of giver and recipient are engaged and failing to return means losing the competition for honour.\"  Food is provided after the payment of bride price and money for the land respectively. When a man gets married in a family, he is given a list of items which he and his kins have to provide to the family of 'their' wife to be. Their is used here to make allusion to the woman. Once married, she becomes the wife of the entire family. The list varies from one family to another, some families are less expensive meanwhile others are really expensive and others are moderate. According to an informant: \"The food is divided into two food for the men and that for the women. Generally, the men may ask for the goat and women the pig. In some families, the men may ask for two goats and the women also ask for two pigs. It equally depends on the amount you can raise. Six cartons of red wine; three for the women and three for the men, a bottle of whisky, crates of beer and palm wine (in good quantity). Two cartons of fish, some bags of rice and a bag of salt\" (15/11/2023).   Food is provided by the buyer of a piece of land to the seller as mentioned above. In the days of old, food given after the buying of land was much but not as much as that offered during traditional marriage. Today many people and families that sell land prefer the buyer gives food in cash. This money which is usually in an envelope is shared to all the members of the seller family if the land sold belonged to the entire family. But if the land is individual land, the seller receives his money. An",

The seller establishes a list of the items that the buyer of the land has to provide. These items may include a pig, twenty liters of palm wine, a carton of fish and many more depending on the seller of the land. The seller on his part informs the head of the family as well as invites the whole community, that is, his 'brothers' and 'sisters' from the village, to share the food. He calls the people of his village (brothers and sisters) because they live in the same community and their communal live warrants them to be one another's keeper. What concerns one family is the concern the entire community. Their invitation is a prove of love and the peaceful coexistence which occurs among them. This food offered after a piece of land has been bought is regarded as a bride price because the Beti people consider land as a woman for many reasons. Upon completion of the food rite, the family of the buyer becomes a part of the family of the land seller\" (17/11/2023).   ## Another Informant Said That:  \"Buying of land is like bride price. When a man buys land from someone else, he gives the seller food. These gifts offered represent love, when someone buys land and still provides food to the seller's family (which is like what obtains in marriage) is not wastage. It is a symbol of love. Even if the family of the seller or the seller asks for food, it is a demonstration of love, if he does not love the buyer, he will not ask for food from him or her\" (19/09/2023).   In the case of land, when someone buys land, the chief known in Beti as *Nkunkuma* of the locality is informed from him to know that, that specific portion of land in his chiefdom has been sold to someone who will from thence be a member of his chiefdom. This said Nkunkuma in the presence of his notables signs a document (known as abandon of customary rites) to symbolise transfer of the land from the seller to the buyer. These traditional dignitaries act as witnesses to the act, and that everything is conducted as tradition demands. As he signs the document, the buyer of the land provides some drinks usually red wine which is shared to all present at the scene. As the wine is drunk, the *Nkunkuma* offers prayers in which he invites the gods and calls on them to recognise the buyer of the land as a new member of the chiefdom, he equally prays and blesses the land, that whatever project Citation: Moffor ET, Alexandre N.

In the case where a man buys land and this ritual is not performed, he is not covered by the *Nkunkuma* nor the ancestors and gods.10\u201313  ## Conclusion  Marriage in most if not all African societies is a union between two families, made possible by a man and a woman. When a man marries a woman he is regarded and treated as an in-law by the wife's family. When a man equally buys land in the Beti locality, he is considered and treated as an in-law. The woman as well as land are very important not only to the Betis but to all Africans. The two serve as a symbol of unity. Once a man marries a woman, the family of the man and that of the woman become united and any event be it happy or sad which concerns one concerns the other. This is the same when a man buys land. When a man purchases land from a family, him or his family unites with that of the seller such that they always commune with each other every time any of the two families have a ceremony. The woman as well as land serve as great riches to the Beti people. When a woman gets married she is expected to give birth to children among which would be girls. Such girl children would be given out to marriage and this (bride price) will bring in so much riches to the family. The children themselves are riches because a true Beti is respected and rated according to the number of children he has. Land on its part will generate a lot of income to its owner if well exploited. The woman and land serve for production. A woman once married has to procreate, bring forth offsprings who will give the family honour as well as continue with the family name. Land is a factor of production, the materials grown on it sold for profit or the businesses invested on, will bring in income to its owner.  ## Acknowledgments  This article was realised thanks to the students of the department of Languages and Cultures of Cameroon (LCC), of The University of Yaounde 1 and a few of my Anthropology students of the same university.

        "sentence_chunk": "# Some Preliminary Notes On Lu.O Marriage Customs. By K. C. Shaw \u2022.  I. INTRODUCTORY.  This account of Luo marriage customs was given to me by half a dozen elders of the Luo tribe, living in a location caned Nyahera about seven miles from Kisumu. All of them were over fifty, ~nd two at least must have been nearing seventy, if they were not older. The question of the age of my informants may seem irrelevant, but in fact it is not. In the first place their advanced age, as age is counted among primitive people, entailed th~t they had been brougb.t up, and had passed their early manhood during a period when the customs of the tribe had still not been affected by contact with European civilisation. Their view of life, and of their duties. 8S members of the Luo tribe was the view that had been t~ken by thmr fathers and their grandfathers before them. In this they differed from their own sons and grandsons whose attitude towards tribal custOIDShas been and continues to be profoundly modified by white influences. This falling away from the traditional ways on the part of the younger generation is not only a source of grief to the old mtln : it is also a source of profound annoyance. For it robs them of a lA.rge part of the prestige and authority which among the Luo, as among other primitive people, is traditionally the due of those who attain to a ripe age. In the old days this prestige and this authority carried great weight. It was the head and fount of power in the tribe, dond the exercise and enjoyment of this power became the chief interest of a man's life as his years increased and his sons grew up and took from his shoulders the family duties and cares of his earlier days. It follows that the decay in the importance of the old men, which is such a marked feature in nearly all the Kenya tribes to-day, makes the elders not only resentful, but also very willing to dwell on the old days, the good days, when their word was l~w, and the young were still in due subjection to the old and the wise. For these two reasons then, their exact personal knowledge of the traditional mode of life of the tribe, and their interest in the days when this mode of life was still the accepted one, the advanced age of my informants was a valuable factor. Also it pleased and flattered them to be appealed to as authorities, and from the beginning to the end of .our intercourse they were only too pleased to tell me all they could of the days when they were young. Apart from a natural inclination to view the past through rosy spectacles they took great pains to give me an accurate account of what the tribal customs used to be before the white man came. Long discussions used to go on over points of ~etail, and it was only when they were all agreed that I was allowed  to write down the authorised version of whatever occurrence it was that I wished to describe. Moreover they warned me not only tpat customs differed slightly from clan to clan and location to location in North and Central Kavirondo, but that the Luo who had crossed the Gulf and gone to live in South Kavirondo differed in a good many ways from the Luo who had rE:)mainedon thE:)north sidE:)of the wawr.  It must therefore be understood that the customs which I am about to describe are those of a group of Luo clans living in a small area in Central Kavirondo, and that there may be discrepancies between my account of these customs and those of other observers in other parts of the tribal area.II. THE MARRIAGE CUSTOMS.  In the old days, before the Europeans took over the government of the Luo country, it seems that a man did not normally marry until he was nearer forty than thirty, and girls did not marry until they were nineteen or twenty. In the case of a man this delay was apparently connecwd with his duties as a warrior. It was considered that a man fought betwr if he were free from the ties \u00b7(,f married life. Though the Luo were never a fighting tribe in the grand manner like the Masai they had for some hundreds of years been pressing southwards through the surrounding Bantu tribes. Raiding for fresh land or even for cattle alone, and the consequent reprisals on the part of the raided, played an important part in tribal life, and every able-bodied man from the age of seventeen or eighteen up to the time of his marriage had to hold himself in constant readiness for a scrap. The term for a man of fighting age was *wuowe,* that for a married man jaot, while that for a man who delayed to marry until much later than usual was mU8omba. After marriage a man seems to have been exempt from all warlike duties and allowed to settle down and devote himself entirely to his family life.  It is likely that this postponement of marriage to a comparatively late age was, apart from its connection with the defence of the tribe, an instance of the reluctance of the older men to surrender even a part of their wealth and power to their sons. A man could not marry without his father's permission, for it was only from his father (except under special circumstances into which I need not enter here) that he could obtain the cattle with which to acquire a bride, and primitive fathers are often no more anxious than some civilised ones to part with large quantities of their worldly goods for the benefit of their children.  There was, however, no hard and fast convention as to the age at which a man might marry. Circumstances altered cases. A mother, for instance, who was without an unmarried daughter, and who wanted another woman to help her in the household work and cultivation, might insist that her son should bring a wife into the family, even if he had not yet reached ordinary marriageable age. Again if there  were other sons by other wives growing up in the dala *(dala.=home-*stead), a woman would hasten the marriage of her own son lest when it came to paying the bride-price for him cattle might be short on account of the claims of other sons on the family resource.  Between the permission to marry, however, and marriage itself, there intervened a long chain of events, extending over months, and sometimes even over years. The mere choice of a bride was hedged about with complications and difficulties that often delayed a man's marriage considerably. This choice was, in tIie first place, limited by the rule that\u00b7 he might not marry any woman related to him. however distantly, either on his father's or on his mother's side of the family. To do this would be to commit incest, and would bring terrible consequences upon the clans and families concerned.  If it happened, as it sometimes did, that a man fell in love with ~ girl without knowing whether. he was related to her or not, only to find that she belonged to one side or other of his own family, the discovery put an end immediately to all intercourse between them. If, on the other hand, it could be established that the two were not related, the man would get permission from his father to take her as his wife, and the usual negotiations would be put in hand. It was, however, more usual for a man to leave the choice of his wife to his father, who would select a suitable maiden with regard only to the mutual advantage of the two families concerned. In this case neither the young man nor the girl were regarded as at liberty to refU''1ethe marriage.  If the son did so, it was at the cost of his father's deep displeasure; and this was a serious matter in the old days when a man was entirely dependent upon his father, not only for the means to acquire a wife.  but for his livelihood in general. So to rebel was unusual. The girl was equally at the mercy of her parents. If she disliked the husband selected for her the only way to escape the match was to run off wIth another man. But if she did this her lover's father would only pay So very small bride price for her, even as little as a single cow, and not only was she considered to have disgraced herself (not unnaturally in view of the severe pecuniary loss suffered by a family losing a daughter for whom the customary cattle had not been received) but her conduct was regarded as a slur on the whole family.  If a. young man was specially",

        "sentence_chunk": "anxious to marry a girl who was not debarred by any relationship from becoming his wife, and who returned his affection, he could establish a sole claim to her by sucking her breast before witnesses. After this ceremony she could not be given in marriage to any other man. The existence of such a custom is sufficient proof that among the Luo, as amOllJ the more civilised, marriage is often the outcome of a. strong personal attraction between a man and a woman. And the fact that tribal custom provides for such a contingency within an otherwise largely utilitarian  systettl should be borne in mind by\" those who are inclined to argue.  that because primitive marriage customs are governed chiefly by practical considerations those who submit to them must necessarily he' lacking in what are known as \u2022\u2022 the finer feelings.\" After the choice of a wife had been made and approved on both sides the next step, until as late as ten years ago, was the ceremoniaL capture of the bride. This was known as mako *nyako* (literally \" the catching of the maiden '')t. The man and one or two of his friendit, armed with clubs and shields would lie in wait for the girl as she went to work in the fields or draw water from the river, and when she came they would take her away with them to his village. She was expected to resist her capture, but not too seriously. As soon as it was known that she had been carried off she was followed by her sisters and as many of her friends as cared to go. On the night of her capture, 'lnd in the presence of her friends intercourse would take place between her and her future husband in the *8imba* hut (the *8imba* hut is the hut inhabited by the unmarried men of the family). The man expected to find her a virgin. If he was disappointed she feU into permanent disgrace. Her parents were furiously angry with her; her husband held her unchastity against her for the rest of her life, and' she returned to her village on the following day in silence and shame, But the marriage was not abandoned nor was the bride-price diminished on this account. If she was found to be virtuous she returned to her home surrounded by her sisters and friends singing, songs and rejoicing, and the whole party were smeared with sim-sim oil, ghi and ashes cn their arrival by the bride's mother. This triumphal return was called omu weT. Before it could take place, however, two other ceremonials had first to be carried out at the bridegroom's *dala.* The first, called *diCTa,* began with the arrivaf there, on the day following the capture of the girl, of a party of young men belonging to her clan. The party was composed of her brothers and some of their friends, armed with clubs and shields. They were met outside the *dala* by the bridegroom and his brothers and some of his friends and a sham fight usually took place between t4e two bands' of young men, though sometimes they did not trouble to stage the traditional mock battle. After the encounter the visitors chose a bull and a heifer from the family herd. The cattle chosen need not neces\u00b7 sarily belong to the bridegroom's father; they might be the property of some other member of the family, and if this was so they were replaced later by beasts belonging to the former and sent to the bride's father. This bull and this heifer Were known as the dho *dieT* and wer\u2022\u2022.  not delivered until a much later stage in the proceedings.  After the bull and the heifer bad been chosen a ceremony of an obviously sacrificial nature took place. A hen was brought by the bridegroom's grandmother (his father's mother). A string was passed' through a hole pierced in the lower part of the hen's beak, and the'  grandmother then hung the bird, still alive, round the neck of the girL Hanging there it was then killed, and immediately afterwards removed by cutting away the lower part of the beak through which the string was passed, leaving this portion still hanging round the girl's neck.  The bird was afterwards roasted and eaten by the men in the *dala.** After the fowl had been removed the girl1(ut on a small apron about six inches square made of strips of leather hanging free from a supporting strip decorated with beads and cowrie shells. Aprons of this kind were manufactured by a man whose special trade it was. The beads on it were made of *mukongo* and the apron itself of cow-hide. The apron given to the bride was not a new one. It was borrowed for her from one of the bridegroom's married sisters, and she took it away with her and wore it until he sent her a new one of her own.  At the same time she put on a small\" tail\" of cactus fibre. This tail, like the larger one ,worn by married women, was known as ohieno, and the plant from which it was made was called tWOTO. If there was no fibre ready in the *dala* from which the *ohieno* could be made, a fresh supply was gathered after the girl's arrival, and the . *ohieno* was constructed by 'a woman married either to one of the bridegroom's full brothers, half brothers, or to one of his first cousins, i.e.  to any of the men whom he called\" brother.\" The small *ohieno* was presented to :he bride by the bridegroom, who first, however, gave her a goat. This goat (diend *ohieno)* was in turn presented by the girl to her best friend who had accompanied her from her home and who was expected to remain close to her side until she returned to her mother's care. The bride wore the small tail until certain cattle, known as the dho golo *onyimbo* (the cattle of the casting away of the onyimbo) were paid to her father. She then took off both the *ohieno* and the *onyimbo,* and they were burnt. I did not, at the time, enquire into the motives and beliefs underlying this ceremony, as enquiries of this kind made through an interpreter seldom have any satisfactory results, but the ceremony is obviously a *rite* de passage marking a stage in the girl's progress from the virgin state to that of 8 married woman. After the night in the simba hut she was no longer entitled to the name of *nyako--a* maiden,--but was referred to as miaha-a bride-a designation that was applied to her until she finally left her father's *dala,* for that of her husband.  After these ceremonies she was sent back to her home with her companions and to the accompaniment of the songs and rejoicings I have already described (omu *weT),* taking with her a goat given her by her father-in-law. This goat was called the diend *buombwe* because it; was decorated for the journey with festooDS of the creeper called buombwe, which was also used in this way on other occasions of rejoicing. Thegoot was given by the girl to her father who could * Women were forbidden to eat fowls (or sheep) for fear that if they did so they would contract chicken-pox *(luro).*  dispose of it as he p.eased. On her return a feast was held-the **t.r.o** nyako-for her and her companions. Preparations for this fean W~ made before her arrival, and the guests invited and the kind of entertainment provided seems to have varied according to the family oircumstances. If the parents were poor only the girl's sisters and the friends of her own age who had accompanied her were present; porridge and milk were set before them, and the guests returned on the same day to their own homes. But if the family was rich, older relations and friends of both sexes were invited and were given meat and beer. The quantity of beer required was often more than could be stored in the accuRtomed place, namely the hut belonging to the girl's mother, and in this case a temporary shelter was built, known as the *siwandha.* It was constructed of reed mats between the mother's hut and the hut next to it, and if the number of reed :r,nats available in the *dala* was insufficient, more were borrowed from the neighbours. After the beer had been drunk the *siwandha* hut was dismantled and its component parts returned to their owners. The guests stayed two or even three days, and it was the convention that before their departure a final meal of meat or of a kind of dried fish called *kabaka* (an expensive dish that cost a goat to buy) should be provided and cooked for them by the mother of the bride.

        "sentence_chunk": "sort of parallel to this feast known as *lupo* then took place in the bridegroom's *dala,* a cow or a goat being sent to him by the bride's parents to be killed and eaten by his brothers and sisters.  After the tero *nyako* and the *lupo-* had taken place a bull known as the dho golo *onyimbo* was paid by the bridegroom, and with them he sent a new *onyimbo,* specially made for her, to the bride. She then returned the *onyimbo* lent to her by the bridegroom's sister, and also took off the Flmall *chieno* and burnt it, being now entitled to wear the big *chieno* of the married woman. This was a bunch of aloe fibre about ten inches long and thick enough to have a diameter of three or four inches. It was tied tightly at the top like a tassel, and was worn hanging from the small of the back, being attached to a string which passed round the waist. This, and a six inch square apron of fibre string was all that a Luo woman wore, apart from her ornaments until the advent of the Indian trader with his cotton piece goods at the beginning of the century. * ~_~ _ * Even now a woman who puts on a cotton dress when she leaves the *dala* some~ times reverts in the privacy of her home to the traditional nakedness adorned only by the tassel and the fringe, and often the dress is put on over the tassel.  This curious ornament has clearly ~ ritual if not a magical significance, of which I hope to obtains details later. I was informed that if a man touches, accideutally or purposely, the tassel of a married woman, he has to pay a fine of three goats to her husband. Moreover, when a woman loses her husband she discards her tassel of aloe fibre and replaces it by one of banana fibre, and this tassel apparently has maleficent properties. For if any man annoys her, she is likely to take it off and beat one of his cows with it, whereupon the cow is regarded as bewitched, and no one will buy it, nr accept it ill payment of a debt.  44 When the dhogolo *onyimbo* had been paid the bull and the heifer -the dho dieT-ch08en by the bride's brothers after the mock battle outside the bridegroom's *da.la,* were sent over by the bridegroom. If, after the dko *dieT* had been received, the marriage was broken off by the bridegroomhe had to pay compensation to the Bride's father for the meat and beer consumed at the feast of the tero *nyako,* and he W8SalSObound to pay one bull for the loss of the girl's virginity. Even it the girl, or her father refused the marriage at this stage, the bridegroomwa8 still bound to pay this bull.  With the payment of the dho *dier* what may be regarded as the ceremonies of the betrothal were completed, and the marriage proceSil entered on a new stage.  The stage was marked by various presents of cattle made by the bridegroom to certain of his future relatives. He gave a number (sometimes as many as fifteen) known as the dho *ikeny,* to the bride's full brothers. If she had no brothers the dho *i1ceny* passed into the ~B8ion of her mother who might, if she wished, allow them to be used in. the payment of bride-price for one of her husband's sons by another wife. (In this case the young wife was expected to treat her step-mother-in-lawas she would treat her own husband's mother, and to help her in the fields and the home.) In addition to the dho *ikeny,* the bridegroomsent a bull and a heifer (the dher wuon *nya1co)* to the bride's father, and another bull and heifer (the dho *jochiemo)* to her uncles on the father's side.  Finally a cow and a calf (the dher min *nyako}* were sent to the bride's mother. These, with their offspring, became her absolute property. She could, if she chose, use them to contribute towt\u00a5'ds the payment of bride price for her sons, or equally could refuse to allow them to be used in this way. After her death they were inherited by her youngest son.  :When all these had been handed over, and it should be noted j;hat they were, apparently, conventional payments, made without question or discussion so long as they were within the means of the parties concerned, like our own engagement rings and wedding presents, then the discussions began about the number of cattle to be paid over in return for the transfer of the girl from one family to another-the true bride price itself. I believe that in some parts the number to be paid over was settled by discussion between the 'heaBs of the two families before the girl had been ceremonially capturii'd. But the elders at Nyahera told me that there the custom was that the bridegroom conducted the discussion with the bride's father himself at this much later point.  He went over himself to the bride's *dala,* accompanied by his brothers and friends to the number of :fifte.enor sixteen, and taking  with him three or four cows. The party entered tbe *dala* very' slowly feigning indifference and reluctance. The bridegroom made himself as inconspicuous as possible, and tried tO,conceal himself in the midst of his companions. No ceremonies took place on the day of arri'\\fal, but the guests were given food and spent the night in the *simba* hut.  On the following day the bridegroom was taken to the hut of the bride's mother and made formally known to her. Meat was killed and the day was spent feasting and drinking. Finally in the evening the bridegroom and the bride's father sat down together and the bargaining began. The rest of the gathering were entertained by a professional minstrel who sang topical songs, some composed to meet the occasion. His fee, incidentally was a goat, which, for some reason I could not discover, had to be presented to him by the bride. He was also given presents by the girl's father and mother.  During the bargaining the bride's father tried to get as large a payment as possible out of the bridegroom. If he was too greedy the negotiations were broken off, and the bridegroom paid compensation for the expenses incurred in entertaining his party and for the loss of the bride's virginity. But if the two came to an agreement that agreement was final, and no further demands on the father's part or subtractions on the part of the bridegroom were allowed, unless the former demanded to see the cattle 'before accepting them. This was sometimes done, and if the cattle were unsatisfactory lie might refuse to proceed with the marriage. If, on the other hand, he trusted the bridegroom, the negotiations were considered closed, and he might even consent to receive a proportion of the bride-price after instead of before the final marriage feast had taken place, and the girl left her home for good. In this case the bridegroom bad to give an extra bull, known as the ruadh *kirisya,* which was sent over for inspection before the feast took place. If it was accepted the final ceremonies were then carried through.  In most cases the bride-price itself was paid by instalments over a period that varied with the ability of the bridegroom's father to meet his liabilities. Usually some months elapsed before the whole number of cattle had been handed over, and it might even be a year or two before the girl's father received all tbat was due to him. During this period it was customary for the girl to pay her future husband a visit from time to time. She was always accompanied on these visits by one or two girl friends, and was expected to stay for several days.  She slept in the *simba* hut with her betrothed, and intercourse took place. It sometimes, though rarely, happened that the girl conceived on one of these occasions. This was bad luck for the girl's parents, but fortunate for the bridegroom, for it was absolutely necessary that the child should be born in his *dala.* He could in consequence hurry on the marriage, which could now take place before the whole of the  dowry had been paid; he was thus enabled to spread his payments of the bride-price over a longer period than would otherwise have been possible. Also the fact that the girl was with child prevented her from being carried off by any other man; apparently a not unheard >Of occurrence.  The wedding feast itself-the *kirisya-took* place in the bridegroom's *dala.* The bride arrived accompanied by her sisters, or, if her sisters",

It was the special duty of this older woman to see that the bride was properly treated, and to make herself polite to the father and mother of the bridegroom. But witb this excepion older men and women were never included in the bride's party. Any man who attached himself to it would have been laughed at for mixing himself up with an affair that concerned women only. On the other hand not only did the bridegroom's sisters attend the feast but, as well, all .bis brothers, half brothers, and first cousins (in other words all the people he called \" brother \"), the wives of his brothers, and -all his male friends.  Asa rule the wedding feast lasted only one day, but if the guests had come long distances, it might last two or even three days. The feast consisted of porridge and meat. The young people were not given beer, but the bridegroom's mother usually brewed a small quantity for her husband and his brothers.  '.I'he meat provided consisted of the flesh of a bull which was cut up and apportioned according to certain definite rules. '.I'he division was the duty of the bridegroom's father, who first of all cut a small piece from the neck and sent it into the bridegroom's mother, who waited in her hut to receive it. He then cut; more small pieces from the neck and scattered them outside and inside her hut. This was an offering to the ancestral spirits, and was accompanied by the following prayer:- Dho waniego dhiang mar dhakonye juogi duto ubi ucham bad iachien aketo nu tieloka kwara gi woura gidega umi iingere *nyani* okwe nat~ kiringia marach obed man gima maber dalo *duto.* Prayer and offering were together intended to placate the ancestral spirits and to persuade them to bless the marriage. After this the right fore leg was cut off and placed in the centre of the mother's hut. This fore-leg had a special name, *badiachien* and was a gift to all the ancestral spirits. It was afterwards eaten by the bridegroom's father and mother, and part of it was dried and sent to the bride's mother.  The whole of the breast, with the exception of a small piece reeerved for the bridegroom\"s brothers, is sent to the brothers of the  ## 47:  bride. It is a cm:ious fact that only young men *(yanyuoyel=* bachelors} may eat this part of the animal. \u00b7The elders told me that in Gem, Alego, Seme, Ugoma, Asembo, Kadimu and Ugenya the breast is **..,t** aside to be eaten in the early morning by the friends of the bride.- groom. But in Kano, Kisumu, Nyakach, and Kabondo it is used &8 I hav:e described.  One fore-leg and one hind-leg were sent to the parents of the bride, and two small pieces of the liver were also allotted to them. The rest of the liver was eaten by the older men living in the *dala,* and the lungs, heart, and stomach were divided and disposed of in the same way as the liver. The thick part of the stomach was also the perquisite of the older men, who also ate the contents oithe small intestine mixed with blood and used as a relish. This concoction was.  called *kichuri* and was highly esteemed. Half of it was sent to the bride's father. Here again there was a difference between the customs of Alego, Gem, Seme, Ugoma, Sakwa, Kadimu, and Ugenya on the one hand, and those of Kisumu, Kano, Nyakach, and Kabondo on the other. For in the former districts *kichuri* was eaten by men and women, whereas in the latter districts only the men were allowed to eat it. This difference may well provide an interesting clue to the past history of these two divisions.  The hump was divided into two parts, one being sent to the bride's parents, and the other half being eaten by the parents of the bridegroom. The ribs and loins were the portion of the women guests, who were also allotted the kidney and the pancreas which men are forbidden to eat, for fear of contracting the disease known as hydrocele. Women with child may not eat these portions in case the child is a boy.  After the *kirisya* was over the girl was regarded as having finally passed into the, fully married state. But even so there were still certain ceremonies which had to be observed before she could take up her residence in her own hut, specially built for her by her husband and there assume the normal duties of a married woman.  The building of this hut was never begun until the wedding feast was over. While it was being constructed the girl slept first in the Bimba hut, and later in her mother-m-law's hut; and before it was finished the girl returned to her own home for a short visit, taking with her that part of the dried fore-leg of the bull (bad *jachien)* which had been set aside for her mother at the wedding feast, as well as other presents of food. It was explained to me that these gifts were in the nature of a compensation to the mother for her absence from her daughter's wedding feast, and they may indicate that in earlier times it was the custom for the motner to accompany her daughter on that occasion. While the girl was at home the mother prepared a ~ge quantity of beer, even as much as nine or ten pots full, and when the girl returned to her husband's *dal~,* not only this beer, 1mb $!so a goat or a sheep, or perhaps a large quantity of fish was sent with her as a present for her husband's parents.  On her return a ceremony known as the rayue *dipa* took place.  It was also known as the wen dipa. *Rayue,* is the name of a plant, and it is also the name for a broom ur brush. *Dipo* is the open space in the middle of the dala. Wen means the stomach contents of an animal. All these elements enter into the ceremony, which consisted of the following events. The father-in-law killed a bull and one of the front legs provided a feast for the family; the hindquarters and tht.  other front leg were set aside to dry, but the\u00b7 stomach contents were strewn over the *dipa* and left there until the evening. Meanwhile the father-in-law made a brush of *rayue* which he gave to the girl, and with this broom a\" dusk, she swept the wen into a heap, afterwards laying hot ashes over it to burn it up. In the morning the ash heap was scattered to the wind. When the dried meat was ready the girl was sent with it to her old home where she presented it to her parents. She then went back to her husband and was allowed to carry out two duties hitherto forbidden her. These were the tending of the fire in her mother-in-law's hut, and the preparation of food for her father-in-law. This indicated that she was at last a full . member of her husband's family and so might render services that only a member of the family was allowed to perform.  After the rayue dip a she lived in her mother-in-law's hut until her own hut was ready. The framework was built by her husband, and he was expected to thatch the roof himself, but his brothers helped him to prepare the mud for the walls and in building them up. When the hut was finished the girl again visited her parents and brought back with her a ram or a billy goat which was Killed to provide a feast to reward the labours of her husband's brothers. Even then, however, the bride might not live independently in her own hut. She was expected to spend the day with her mother-in-law, doing all the laborious parts of the house work and generally holding herself at the beck and call of the older woman. This arrangement normally continued only until the birth of a child, but if the two women got on well together it might endure until a second child was born, when it invariably came to an end. On the other hand if one of the husband's full brothers married the younger woman was immediately relieved of her duties to her mother-in-law by the new brIde. Failing both this avenue of escape and the birth of a second child she continued in her mother-in-Iaw's service until her husband could afford to take a second wife, when her duties again would devolve upon th.e new-comer.

In contemporary Kenyan Law on marriage and divorce, bridal negotiation and payment is regarded as central evidence of the validity of customary marriage and in the establishment of the legality of such union. Gendered identities in this case refer to the social and cultural construction of the femininities and masculinities perspectives which are known to influence and shape the practices of social institutions. This paper focuses on the formal discursive process of negotiating and legalising marriage in the domain of '*Ruracio*' or bride wealth payment amongst the *Agikuyu* of Kenya. Data consisted of five recorded discourses from sampled negotiation sessions and five focus group discussions from Kiambu County, Kenya. The data collected was translated, transcribed and analysed with a view of investigating language use for gendered identities and their implication on society. Guided by principles in discourse historical approach, the study established that language use in this domain defines gender roles, perspectives and identities which are useful in constructing individual and societal identity. It is hoped that these findings will benefit the general public as they interact linguistically. 199 words Keywords: Gendered identities, bride wealth, Gender roles, femininities, masculinities 1. Introduction In anthropological literature, bride price (referred to also as marriage considerations in law) has often been explained in market terms as payment made in exchange for the bride's family's loss of her labour within her kin group. Gift exchange has been an important integral part of marriage rites and ceremonies in African culture. In most, it is the men folk who participate in discussions that determine what, how much and how such a payment is made (Kaye et al, 2005).Among the *Agikuyu,* marriage consideration is necessary to the validity of the marriage and to establish the affiliation or legal control of the issue of the union. The law of Kenya (cap 150, 2008) recognizes the legality of a marriage contracted under the native or custom law.   This is the kind of marriage that is sealed by payment of bride wealth even if there isn't any other official celebration of the marriage. Marriage negotiation like any other form of negotiation is a social behaviour that is enacted within the domain of language. Every utterance made and every text written within a negotiation is an act with repercussions on the outcome. It is important for negotiators to recognise the power of language and to understand its potentialities as a negotiating instrument (Lickson et. al, 2005). It is against this background that this study interrogates language used in *Gikuyu* marriage negotiations for aspects of gendered identities and their implications on society.  One way of establishing our identity and shaping other people's views of who we are is through our use of language. Language being an important aspect in the construction of individual and social identities can be a powerful means of exercising social control. Being a member of a particular group or community often means adopting the linguistic conventions of that group, not just in relation to words use but also in relation to the way you see them. The way those conventions are defined and maintained is usually \"controlled by the group rather than the individual\" (Thomas et.al. 2004, p.158).   Language can be used to construct personal identities. This happens through names, naming practices and rituals together with systems of address. These aspects are central to this study because address systems are culturally determined for example the way they are used to help establish identity within a context. Culture also determines the degree of formality, of intimacy and of relative relationship status of the participants involved in the interaction. Disregard of the rules can lead to some form of disapproval or sanctions or at worst be interpreted as an insult. They are used to express attitudes such as inferiority which can signal refusal to recognize one's status especially when repeatedly used (Thomas, et.al. 2004). The words that speakers choose to address people in are important ways of situating themselves in relation to others such as creating social distance or intimacy, marking difference, condescension or insult, all done through the conventions of the address systems of a language.  According to Wodak (1997), men and women actively choose ways of framing to accomplish specific ends within particular interaction. These choices are drawn in part from sociocultural norms for how men and women are expected to accomplish such actions through talk. Individuals' language choices in interactions invoke these gendered norms and thus perform gendered identities as well. Gendered ways of framing are resources for accomplishing the speaker's purpose. She further argues that these are maintained and (re)created through social practices including language practice. Thus language practice and gendered identities are dynamically linked in interaction. Spade and Valentine (2007) too have argued that as the practice of gender interacts with other social prisms such as ethnicity, age, race and social class, complex and dynamic patterns of meanings are created.. Some of these have been addressed in this research paper.  ## 2. Materials And Methods  The study was carried out in Kiambu County, Kenya. This is a predominantly rural county but according to the Institute of Social accountability (Tisa), its urban population is increasing as Nairobi city is rapidly growing. The Agikuyu are the dominant tribe. The county is divided into five administrative regions namely; Githunguri, Kiambaa, Kikuyu, Lari and Limuru. One *Gikuyu* marriage negotiation and a focus group discussion were captured from each of these regions so that the study would capture regional variations and dynamics if any. To gain access to sites and individuals involved in the study, permission was sought from the relevant authorities: The National Commission for Research, Technology and Innovation and the Kiambu county administration. The target population was the *Gikuyu* community particularly those involved in marriage negotiations. Since this is an unspecified population, the sample items for the study were selected deliberately by the researcher.  The study used a purposive sample of five marriage negotiation sessions where each was capturing a different stage of the five key steps of a *Gikuyu* marriage negotiation. Creswell (2007) has observed that a study of this nature intentionally samples a group of people that can best inform the researcher about the research problem under study. In this respect, groups that were undertaking the practice and were willing to allow the researcher to video or tape record the proceedings were identified. The focus groups were constituted by bringing together at least six",

Results And Discussion  The focus of analysis, interpretation and discussions in this section are on language use and its influences on the concept of gender as reflected through the discursive domain of *Gikuyu* marriage negotiation.   ## 3.1 Gendered Identities 3.1.1 Gender Stereotypes  Gendered identities in this case refer to meanings that arise from the varieties of speech associated with a particular gender such as; dominance versus subjection, attentiveness, gender stereotypes and beliefs regarding masculinity and femininity among others.. Evident in the study is the fact that there are separate and distinctive roles played by men and women during the negotiations. Marriage negotiation ceremonies focus on issues of gender in a prescriptive sense of assigning tasks and in structuring language in such a way that societal values and expectations are communicated and negotiated.   This refers in a sense to an aspect of oversimplifying and standardizing the way a concept is viewed. In this study, language use demonstrates stereotyping through some terminologies used. For example the term \"*kugurwo*\" that refers to the action of negotiating for a bride. Generally the word implies that the bride is 'bought' with the groom as the 'buyer'. This usage in a sense (albeit unconsciously) relegates the woman to the substandard position of a commodity that is owned. Consider the following examples; F2\u2026the procedure was followed and I expect that when my daughter is negotiated for '*kugurwo*'::: the same procedure should be followed FG1 F1 ((\u2026 when time came for me to sell '*kwendia'* my daughter (meaning having the daughter negotiated for)  my brothers had to explain that I was paid up for and that the same:: procedure must be followed in my daughter's case))   FG1 In the first example, the speaker uses a prolongation and a raised voice for emphasis while in the second the researcher maintains a direct translation so that the original implication is not lost. From the two examples, it is clear that the society understands negotiation to mean that the woman is the 'commodity' for this bargaining process.   According to Thomas et.al (2004), there is a perceived link between how we talk about things and how we construe them. For instance in this case, the word '*kugurana'* within the said context, is used in a way that not only alleviates the fear of misrepresentation but also mitigates our responsibility in this kind of a 'buying' process. Thus in such a case, people are able to exploit the links between language use and perceptions. Secondly, the fact that the term cannot be used in a reciprocal relationship shows a situation of power differentiations.  Gender roles seen through the cultural practice that a family should have a spokesman whom they feel will fully represent them and safeguard their interests at the negotiation also signal societal stereotypes. Marriage discourse, which begins at the home of the groom's father, involves appointment of main spokesperson who is a male  (preferably an uncle) and a female (preferably an aunt) spokesperson to represent women. The appointment of male and female spokespersons is done in the light of clear separation of roles during the negotiations. The main negotiations for bride wealth are led by spokesmen from both sides. Usually, an uncle acts as the spokesperson as illustrated through the excerpt below: F2: Ehh::: not necessarily an uncle. This is because the relationship amongst members of the family matters.   There could be an uncle who is not close to the family having negotiations. In such a case, some people opt for a close family friend. Usually, whoever is chosen as a spokesman is briefed on what to say at the negotiation. However, the uncle as a choice spokesman is considered the best since he knows the family and understands how traditionally they carry out such events.  F 1: There is a *Gikuyu* proverb that says \"No one is able to shave the back of his *head*.\" Therefore, traditionally, the Gikuyu believed that it would be wrong to talk \"tau tau tau\" before the in-laws\u2026  FG 1 Whoever is chosen as a spokesman is briefed on what to say at the negotiation. The choice is done in line with sociocultural norms that govern how men and women accomplish tasks through talk (Wodak, 1997).The main task in this case is the safeguarding of the family's interests.   While the bride's spokesman has ideological power since it is from him that the groom's side wants to 'get something', this power is usually resisted through some available set of resources (Foucault ,1977) in this case the power of negotiation, hence the need for an astute negotiator. For example; BSPM: Ok. That's good. Now that we have permission, we go back to the groom's spokesman. I think \"the visitor is usually the carrier of news\". So what news do you bring to us?  GSPM: I am so grateful for this opportunity and for being accepted in this home. Our main intention is to know G____'s home because we have never come here. We have come willingly, so because we know and can see that you are good people we believe we shall agree:: Do not send us away. The groom's spokesman here uses politeness to not only demonstrate that he recognizes that the bride's spokesman has power but also to indicate that he has intentions of mitigating even in the face of such powers.  The spokesman from the bride's side first explains the traditions regarding bride wealth expectations in that particular family. The explanation too serves to demonstrate the powers that he has over the whole event but even as he does this, he is careful in his choice of words.  BSPM: I know you are guilty of all that but I can't talk with nothing in my hand. You have said you came to report yourself but I know a few steps that you must also fulfill and it all depends on your readiness. If you want to report yourself, start payment of dowry (kiaara) so that I count for you (*kuuna miti*) and you *'kuguraria'* tomorrow, I am ready. It all depends on you\u2026  **(CASE 2)** This demonstrates that the parties involved understand that language practice and gender identities are usually dynamically linked in interaction (Wodak, 1997) and that they influence and shape meaning and interactions (Foucault, 1977). This probably is the reason why this interaction is in the form of a narrative structure, sometimes punctuated with some dramatics as in the example below:  BSPM: There is nothing I need to be reminded of. Just give me what you have::: and then we can talk. ((He is given some money)). Let me first take water. ((takes the water as everybody anxiously waits, then continues to talk)).   Let us go in stages. First, there is the fine for theft::: what you have given is not enough. You cannot show me goats and then you go back and hide them. (referring to the money the groom's spokesman is returning to the pocket. Continues\u2026)).  We now go to the Next step- goats that you brought as a gift for coming to see your bride's home ((he is given some more money which he accepts))\u2026 (CASE 2) The excerpt indicates some dramatics from the bride's spokesman; takes time to count the money, takes some water, emphasizes his words by use of raised voice, and pauses in between talk, all in an effort to demonstrate that he is the main person and the only one to call the shots. It is for the groom's party to 'read' the underlying meaning and do an appropriate decoding. Their interpretation is what will shape the way the interaction continues.According to the conventions of interactions in the discursive domain under study, parents do not act as spokespersons.",

        "sentence_chunk": "In a sense, though the bride's side knows that they have power, they too exercise it cautiously to safeguard future relationships. A participant in one of the discussions intimated that the *Agikuyu* believed that negotiating for your own child may look like you are '*selling her'* which doesn't come out very well. It is ironical that the word used denotes the very meaning that they seem to be safeguarding themselves against.   F2: The *Gikuyu* also believed that negotiating for your own child may look like you are 'selling her'\u2026  FG1 Culturally, 'a child belongs to the community'. At negotiation, this communal aspect is enhanced and that is why some of the *'ngoimas'* (goats) asked for are meant for the clan to feast as demonstrated through the excerpt below; M2: A common belief among the *Agikuyu* is that children belong to the clan. The clan therefore must be told that their daughter is getting married. That is why the *'ngoimas'* are slaughtered for them.   FG 4 Generally, the language and cultural choices made invoke gendered norms and the ways of framing chosen help to accomplish the speakers' purpose (Wodak, 1997). In this case, the purpose is to explain the need for communal participation and how important safeguarding such a relationship is.  Gendered roles in the discursive domain are also defined through the different types of *'maaha'* (miscellaneous items) asked for by the bride's spokesman and woman.  Women then would be given a chance to ask for their things\u2026an axe,water container, something to tie firewood and a machete\u2026 **(FG 2)** A look at the things women asked for clearly shows that they define their roles such as; they are responsible for the cooking (firewood), fetching water, and cultivating all of which are duties that serve her family. The man on the other hand mainly asked for honey (to prepare beer), and a container for tobacco both of which serves him as an individual.  F1: After this, women are given a chance to ask for their properties called *'maaha' (*miscellaneous items).   These are items besides the animals such as tobacco, a sword with a sheath and a honey barrel for the father while mother's ask for cultivating knife, big gourd, an axe, leather strap and cooking pot.  F 2: The list of *'maaha'* should be moderate and culturally meaningful.  ( Case 5) Such a social practice demonstrates Wodak's (1997) view that language practice and gendered identities are dynamically linked in interaction and that the choices of framing made which are drawn in part from sociocultural norms accomplish specific tasks within interactions.  Gender identities that are stereotypical are also revealed in advisory roles during the marriage ceremonies among the *Agikuyu.* The bride is advised by the mother, aunt, grandmother or elderly women in the society as seen in the discourse below: BSPM: Now that we have introduced ourselves I wasn't to ask that you tell us why you and your delegation have visited this home. First of all, I want to ask G_______, who are these people and what are they are doing at your father's home?  G________: ((Doesn't know what to say but is advised by her 'mother')).    **(Case 2)** On the other hand, the groom is advised by the father, uncle, grandfather or elderly male member in the community. As observed by Spade and Valentine (2011), the interaction of gender and the social prism of age in this case (where the older are advising the younger) bring out an identity and relationship pattern which demonstrates power differentiation between the older (advisor) and the young (the advised).  The role of the father as the head of the family is clearly indicated through ideological practices such as when a young man wanted to get married, he first informed his father symbolically by brewing beer for him to show that he was a grown up with his own sugarcane farm (Leakey,1977). The father had to give him a go ahead. On the other hand, a girl through the mother had to inform the father that she had received a proposal for marriage. The discourse below demonstrates the important role performed by the fathers. Only by their permission would such ceremonies proceed: M2: After a relationship that leads to marriage whether it is the bride and groom meeting on their own, introduced by parents or even elopement, negotiations only starts when the bride's father is informed of the intention by another family to start in law relationships with home and he accepts.  M1: Remember that the groom's parents have to send three elders to announce such intentions= M 2: =The groom's father once given an okay starts preparing beer that he will take to his intended in-laws.   This is taken to the bride's father as a way of introduction and expression of gratitude.   ( FG 4) BSPM: The best thing would be you come and talk to the parents. You may not need a big delegation. I  believe we shall agree. Remember that the journey has landmarks that direct one on the right way. You need to come back so that the landmarks are pointed out to you; otherwise you can lose the way.   **(CASE 1)** Only the bride's father can give a go ahead for the marriage to take place. He is also a leader in the family as seen from the second discourse (above) where even the spokesman cannot make some decisions but must defer to him. (Leakey, 1977) observes that fathers as heads of families would gather their families before going to pay bride wealth and together they would pray that the animals would get for them a prudent wife. This study too witnessed a similar practice where the father gathered together all those going for the ceremony and led them into prayer as demonstrated by the excerpt below: ((\u2026On the material day, the delegation gathered at the groom's father's home. The groom's father, the groom and the spokespersons held some talks and prepared themselves. The preparation involves putting the \"goats\"  (in this case, money) together; furnishing the spokesman with any details he needed to know how to negotiate in their favour and prayer to invoke God's presence\u2026)) (CASE 2) The fact that this practice continues even today shows that the *Agikuyu* have reverence for their God and recognise that he can influence outcomes of issues.  ## 3.1.2 Dominance Versus Subjection  The practice of negotiation brings out identities of dominance which are clearly demonstrated through songs.   A closer look at the way reception of the groom's party is handled reveals the dominant privileged position of the bride's side .This reflects a prescriptive way of assigning tasks which also brings into focus gendered identities.   Women play the lead role in ushering in the parties. Before the actual payment of bride wealth, there was the ceremony called \"*Kuhanda ithigi*,\" where the prospective in- laws must first visit the bride's home in a sense \"to know where it is.\" The women are in control at the introductory part of these sessions. The 'knocking of the door' is done using a song and the key players here are women. The groom's relatives led by the women have to request to be allowed in by the use of songs. On the other side, the women from the bride's home respond by teasing their groom counterparts. The bantering through singing continues between the women from the sides until the women from the groom's side give a token through the closed gate so that apparently 'the bride's relatives can look for the keys'. This time, the men from both sides are just standing on the sidelines watching this drama which also serves to demonstrate the side that has power. It is also the women from the bride's side who eventually allows the groom's party to get in after they are satisfied that they have been respectful enough. This is clearly illustrated through the excerpt below: ((\u2026On arrival at the bride's home, ..The bantering through singing continues between the women from the sides until the women from the groom's side gave a token through the closed gate so that apparently 'the bride's relatives can look for the keys.' This time, the men from both sides are just standing on the sidelines watering this drama.The women are in control in this session...   ## (Case 2)  The songs",

        "sentence_chunk": "convey honor and appreciation especially for the bride's mother. They also serve to demonstrate that the bride's party has a dominant position. According to Hale (1998), such kind of negotiation techniques are influenced by an understanding of what the terms 'concession' and 'compromise' means for the participants in the discourse. In this case, the songs serve to demonstrate that they value their daughter and shielding her is only meant to pass this message across to the groom's party otherwise they cannot bar her from getting married since it is an obligation. Once the ushering in is concluded by the women and the eating is over, men take over the proceeding stage which entails introduction and payment of bride wealth. Women regain control of the second and the last stage of negotiations in which women in the groom's entourage present their gifts to the bride's family. The stage is led by spokeswomen from both parties and takes a very short time.  The marriage song in the *Agikuyu* community is the monopoly of women. According to Hale (1998), an   ![7_image_0.png](7_image_0.png)  understanding of the creative power of language is important in shaping people's thoughts and contributing to perspectives that underlie the language choice as it influences the thinking and outcome of the negotiation, in this case, the women participating in the singing and the men taking over the discourse. Such participants will have an opportunity to reflect on whether the language choices and use made are manipulative. Another aspect of gendered identity is demonstrated through dominance in terms of talk in this domain. In the data collected for this study, an observation of turn-taking during both the focus group discussions and the negotiation events show that women are not a dominant voice during such discussions as illustrated in the figure below: The graph above serves to demonstrate the fact that *Gikuyu* marriage negotiation discursive domain is male dominated judging by the turns taken by each gender; an average of 71.5 per cent for the males and 28.5 per cent for the females in the discourse under study. While we could argue that *Gikuyu* marriage negotiations by nature would give the men an upper hand being the key negotiators, one wonders why a similar scenario is reflected in the focus groups yet this is a forum where both men and women have an equal chance of contributing to the discussion. In a sense, an observer feels that women have accepted that this is not their domain and therefore act as just passive participants. A close examination of speech practices is useful to the study in that it provides insights into gender related issues for instance who is dominant in this discursive domain. Such an assumption is however ideological and according to Fairclough (1989), they are usually taken for granted yet, they serve as a means of legitimizing existing social relations through ordinary familiar ways of behaving which take power differences for granted. By illuminating these power differential issues, this study concurs with Fairclough's (1989) view that there is need to increase consciousness of how language contributes to the domination of some people by others.  As Marks and Yardley (2004) have observed, an analysis of both content and context brings out the social relationship between participants, their roles, lives, history and culture. Except during the *'itara'* when the groom's family hosts the bride's family, all the other occasions involve the spokesmen from the two sides engaging in a grueling negotiating process. The discourse between the two is characterised by language use that is aimed at demonstrating who is in control (the bride's spokesman) and therefore shaping the discussion, while the groom's spokesman has to demonstrate humility. The two dominate talk and it is only towards the end when women are given a chance to ask for their things called '*maaha'* which are usually predetermined and obvious. In fact, by the time that the spokesmen are through with their business, there is a sigh of relief from all the people present as though everything has come to an end. This makes one to feel like the women's session is not given enough weight. It is no wonder that their presence in the discourse is a dismal 21 per cent.   This kind of scenario communicates some insights regarding gender and dominance in this discursive domain in particular how activities in this process influence the socio-cultural products and elements of discourse (Marks &  Yardley, 2004).   ## 3.1.3 Beliefs Regarding Femininity And Masculinity In The Discursive Domain  These identities arise from societal expectations regarding the woman. This study contends that male superiority or right of authority over women is evident in this discursive domain. This kind of power is believed to be embedded in the bride wealth cultural practice. For instance, during the *'ngurario'* ceremony, a woman is given the 'kiande' meat together with goat's ears. The meanings attached to these discourses indicate clearly what society has prescribed for the woman once bride wealth has been paid for her. This agrees with Wodak and Meyer's (2004) argument that power is exerted through a person's control of the social occasion.  M1: Normally, the *'kiande'* (scapula) is cut only once in a woman's life. That could only suggest that such couples never adhered to this requirement when it was supposed to be done. This has also come as a result of people understanding that a true *Gikuyu* bride is one who has undergone this ceremony\u2026 (FG 4) The emphatic way through which the male respondents use, (shown by the underlined responses in the data),  shows that this is a view that they strongly hold. This kind of language use reveals how historical dimensions can serve to constitute power and exploitation (Wodak & Meyer, 2004). Such an attitude creates a lot of gender imbalance. Another phenomenon is where Women were required to prove their worth by going to cultivate the man's farm as described by respondents during the focus group discussions in the excerpts below: F 1: \u2026Something else that used to happen is that after the payment of the required bride wealth, the bride would be told to go and cultivate in one of the groom's farms ((before she is married)). The groom would be hidden somewhere to see how hardworking or lazy his intended wife is. The girl was supposed to cultivate without standing up as this would be interpreted as laziness= (FG 2) The fact that the man does not have to go through a similar evaluation demonstrates a situation of power imbalance. The unfairness underlying this is that society assumes that the man has nothing to prove. Since such an approach has historical reverberations, this study contends that there is need for modern society to consider and recognize the power of language and its potentialities within this discursive domain and how the same contributes in shaping people's thoughts (Cohen, 2001).  While in some cases ideologies of gender equivalence are clearly articulated for instance the fact that both males and females have a chance to ask for 'maaha', the value of the items asked for by women in comparison to the men's (who have to ask for the animals as well) shows differentiations. As Spade and Valentine (2011) have observed, gender practices and meanings are a montage of intertwined social divisions and connections that both pull us apart and bring us together. This therefore is an area that needs to be addressed so that the repercussions do not pull the language users in this domain apart as they seek to apply the definitions as provided within the available societal definition particularly in modern society which has redefined some terms and practices within the discursive domain.According to the researcher's observations, in terms of identity, language forms in the discursive domain are structured in such a way that the woman is portrayed as a vulnerable member of society. She first belongs to her father who on getting a number of animals practically hands her over to another man, her husband, as illustrated through the excerpts below: M1: =After",

        "sentence_chunk": "the agreed bride wealth was paid, the groom would come with his friends to visit the bride. They would find she had made porridge which is to be given to his groom referred to as *'mugurani'* (( a term that is used to refer to a buyer of an item)).The groom would be given the porridge to sip by his bride \u2026Bride price however must have been agreed upon and part of it paid up.  M1: ... The ceremony being done in the open made the whole clan aware that the bride is fully paid up for;  'nimugure.'  FG 3  ## 3.1.4 Women As Passive And Subservient Members Of The Society  The terminologies used; *'mugurani', 'nimugure'* among others clearly depicts some kind of ownership through buying. The fact that the woman shifts ownership after such an exchange more so after hard bargaining seems to accentuate this perspective. Society has ensured that she does not have a say over the children she gives birth to as they virtually belongs with the family that paid bride wealth for her (Leakey, 1977). Bride wealth also makes her assume another identity 'belonging to the man'. The fact that this kind of a societal definition of gender seems not to be contested by the woman (observations from the data collected) can only be understood through an analysis and investigation of the historical background of the social field in which the discursive event is embedded (Wodak & Meyer,2004).  The data collected reveals that the *Agikuyu* community expect women to be passive and subservient is substantial matters in the marriage ceremonies. Men take part in major decision making processes such as determination of the bride price and the discourse on the modalities of payment of the bride wealth as in the excerpts below:  F 1: Together with what we had mentioned earlier on, there is also the issue of culture which has always been that way. It is also considered as a sign of disrespect for a woman to negotiate for bride wealth.    FG1 M1: =When it came to the actual negotiation which involved the goats, women had no place in the matter.   Their role was cooking for the in laws.  M1: The talks were held in the *'thingira'* (the man's hut)\u2026((The man's hut was not a place for women))\u2026  FG 3   These examples clearly concur with Thomas et.al's (2004) argument that there is a perceived link between how we talk about things and how we construe them. One of the male respondents argue that the bride wealth negotiation table was not a place for women, a position that is reinforced by the cultural practice of holding the talks in a man's hut (women usually visited the place on invitation by the man). According to Katz et. al (1998), language constructions make significant constrains on the interpretation process and context.  Another aspect is where women would be given some beer to go and drink from inside the house because they are not supposed to take it while men watch. Men however, would take theirs in the open (an aspect of power differentials) as seen from the response below: M 2: The beer brought by the groom's relatives is meant for all; men and women but in separate gourds. The two should also take the same differently. During such occasions women are allowed to drink but must avoid misbehavior.   FG 4 This shows how society makes different demands on the woman and prescribes what is right or wrong for her. This in a sense makes her look like a vulnerable member of society. In Katz's (1998) view, interpretations of concepts are dependent on culture as well as knowledge for such interpretations. For instance, one wonders whether it is only women who are capable of misbehaving while drank. Furthermore, the emphatic tone used by the respondent (demonstrated by use of the underlining in the excerpt) conveys an extra meaning such as his own opinion regarding this concept. Since he is an elder, it is possible that his opinion could represent many others in society. This concurs with Schiffrin's (1994) argument that language creates and is created by social context such that an individual's actions produce and reproduce knowledge through which his or her conduct and social circumstances are intelligible.  ## 3.1.5 Productivity Of The Bride  Productivity of the bride is a quality that *Agikuyu* community values. Before a man decides to marry, he must ascertain that the bride-to-be is industrious. The industriousness of the bride would be determined by the ability to till the land, cultivate and execute domestic chores. After the payment of the required bride wealth, the bride would be told to go and cultivate in one of the groom's farms (before she is married).   The groom would be hidden somewhere to see how hardworking or lazy his intended wife is. The girl was supposed to cultivate without standing up as this would be interpreted as laziness. In fact \"even if anything bit her, she could not stand to check or scratch herself\" as observed from the responses below: F 1: \u2026Something else that used to happen is that after the payment of the required bride wealth, the bride would be told to go and cultivate in one of the groom's farms ((before she is married)). The groom would be hidden somewhere to see how hardworking or lazy his intended wife is. The girl was supposed to cultivate without standing up as this would be interpreted as laziness= FG 2 When the man determined that they were paying for a hard worker, arrangements for picking her would be made. She would be taken to the groom's mother's hut and put on the girl's bed and her friends on learning this would come and join her for eight days of mourning.  After the girl is married and she happens to be lazy or quarrelsome among the man's relatives will be saying  \"our goats were a waste\" or the groom could say, \"My goats got lost\". A common expression was, \"our goats were carried away by the waters as we crossed the river\" as reflected by the excerpt below: M2: After the girl is married and she happens to be lazy, quarrelsome among the man's relatives will be saying \"our goats were a waste\" or the groom could say, \"My goat got lost.\" A common expression was, \"our goats were carried away by the waters as we crossed the river.\")) (FG 2) According to Kanogo (2005),the custom (among others) was used to control women and limit their attempts to determine their marriages while Anderson (2007) contends that bride wealth can be associated with recognition and valuing of a woman's productivity. He further argues that the importance of these relationships had not been empirically tested. This study in addressing this knowledge gap illuminates how the cultural practice constitutes power for the man over the woman for whom he has paid bride wealth and the expectations of society for such a woman.   Such consciousness as Fairclough (1989) argues is a step towards social emancipation.  ## 3.1.6 Right To Ownership Of The Bride Wealth  The right to the bride wealth was predominantly a preserve of the male gender. The bride wealth was paid to the bride's father. The six goats offered to open up the negotiation were called *'ugendi' and* were meant to be distributed to bride's brothers.   ((The bride's father was usually not in a hurry to be paid the few remaining. He however ensured that one of his sons (usually the last born) was given the mandate to ask for the remaining goats should the man die before they have been fully paid particularly if he needed a boost for his own bride wealth payment.)) FG 2 The sisters were not entitled to the bride wealth. Women's right to ownership during the negotiations were limited to tools for household chores as seen below: F3:. Women then would be allowed a chance to ask for certain things that were almost predetermined; 'ithanwa, mukwa wangu, ndigithu ya mai na ruhio'that is ;an axe a panga, water container and something to tie firewood.= FG 2 By their nature, those items defined women's duties. Secondly, the father takes care of his sons in terms of property ownership in the event of his death while nothing is mentioned about his daughters. These are some of the common sense assumptions which Fairclough (1989) argues contributes to the domination of some people by others.  ## 3.1.7 Bride As A Source Of",

        "sentence_chunk": "Wealth And The Price Tag On \"Femaleness\"  The study established that the bride is treated as a source of wealth and the community attaches a price tag on  \"femaleness\". During one of the marriage ceremonies the groom's spokesman started his address by stating that: GSPM \"we have come to apologize for taking someone's 'goat,' and staying with it without reporting\"   (CASE 1) In this context, the bride is considered a source of family wealth 'goat'. Living with her husband without fulfillment of this customary requirement for traditional marriage (bride wealth payment) is equated to stealing because her family had not benefited from her. The groom by having not paid the bride wealth makes him equated to a thief. Such an assumption is ideological and as Fairclough (1989) has observed, closely linked to power: in this case for instance, a marriage where bride wealth is not paid is equated to \"theft\" - a loss to her father and brothers in terms of material property. This study thus concludes that such a gender identity is socio-culturally constructed and serves to define expectations of how men and women behave (Wodak, 1997).  ## 3.2.7 Women As Men'S 'Property'  A married woman is considered her husband's 'property'. A woman who had undergone *'kuguraria'* ceremony could not remarry even after a divorce. Even if they separate for whatever reason for a number of years, only her husband has a right to bury her if she dies. *'kuguraria'* meant she belonged to him forever: M2: This is the true *Gikuyu* wedding where the *'kiande'* scapula is cut\u2026*Gikuyu* bride undergoes the cutting of the scapula ceremony, she is forbidden from remarrying even if the husband were to die. This kind of marriage also does not have divorce.  ((Even if she were to differ with her husband, she cannot be sent back to her father's family. She belongs with the husband's family.))\u2026 **FG 4** Children born in such a marriage belonged with the family that paid the bride wealth (Leakey, 1977) this cultural marriage is very different from others (Christian, Hindu, Muslim or Civil) in this perspective. For Kanogo,(2005), such discourses associated with bride wealth represent the cultural struggles over control of marriage and women's position in the family among the *Agikuyu*.  ## 3.1.9 Man As The Head In The Marriage  Man is considered as the head in the marriage. This concept is well demonstrated in the '*Kiande'* ceremony where the groom cuts for his bride the shoulder meat of a goat. She was also given 'ears' to signify that she will be a good listener. The cutting also signified that any four legged animal in a home is the man's. That the man is the only one to be slaughtering and the woman can only wait to be given is also another meaning attached to the man cutting for his wife the scapula section of goat meat. The other part of the goat meat given to a bride are the goat's ears signifying that she is going to be a wife who listens to her husband. Listening in this context has also the connotation of obedience that is; the woman is expected to be subject to her husband particularly after he has cut the '*kiande'* for her.  ((\u2026cutting his wife the scapula section of goat meat. As the elder leading the ceremony explained, the ceremony of cutting the scapula marks an equivalent of a wedding ring\u2026The other part of the goat meat given to a bride are the goat's ears signifying that she is going to be a wife who listens to her husband\u2026)) CASE 4  ## Conclusion  The conclusions in this paper are that gender identities in the Gikuyu bride wealth negotiation discursive domain manifest in the different roles played by male and female during the marriage ceremonies: men are the main negotiators while women have subsidiary roles such as welcoming the parties and creating good rapport Gender identities are also manifested in the advisory role played by men and women. All these clearly demonstrate a clear separation of roles and responsibilities for males and females during marriage negotiations.   The cultural values and practices among the Agikuyu community define how 'maleness' and 'femaleness' is perceived in the society. Women are expected to be passive and subservient in major decision making processes. For instance, women are not involved in the determination or bargain for the bride price. Women are also secluded from open participation is some traditional events such as taking beer to celebrate successful talks. The society expects a woman to be industrious while the right to ownership of the family wealth is conferred on men. The bride is treated as a source of wealth but the right to own the bride wealth was predominantly a preserve of men. The overriding perception is that male gender is dominant in this society.   ## Acknowledgement  Special thanks go to all our respondents from Kiambu County for their willingness to participate in this research and enabling us to collect the relevant data.

It draws particularly the wedding songs pragmatics in societies in which communication is an oral cultural basis. From these views, the topic elaborates cultural perception of a certain community, regarding wedding songs to illustrate a handful of characteristics of civilized rules held by the tradition. This topic treats from the view of pragmatic meaning the problem of wedding songs in which, an extracted version is taken from informants to analyze the impact of these oral communication characteristics. Pragmatically, the analysis has thus outlined many communicative aspects to convey knowledge, to inherit social and cultural practices, and to educate the young generation, while serving adults as guides. This topic contributes to cultural diversity and traditional apprehension around different concepts in African societies generally, and the Saalum community particularly. Keywords pragmatics, analysis, wedding songs, saalum  ## 1. Introduction  In African societies, values are based on cultural and traditional foundations that vary from one community to another. The celebration of marriage holds religious and customary aspects. This transversality conveys common significance, mainly the transmission of values and beliefs. Marriage in the traditional patriarchal society of Africa is performed with great importance and dignity. With this social practice of marriage comes other traditional customs which are very much indispensable in African society without which marriage is incomplete (Bedana, Longjam, & Sangeeta Laishram, 2014). On wedding days, women sing traditional songs, not only to show their happiness; but also to educate the bride and bridegroom (Mtose & Xoliswa, 2011, pp. 96-102). All cultures undergo changes, but the residues of culture survive into the civilized area in the forms of traditional songs, games, narratives, and customs (Tylor, 1871, p. 1). Wedding \"involves several ceremonies each of the ceremonies may have its own songs and dance, and other rituals\" (Tylor, 1871, p. 1). From these basic principles, the celebration of marriage had an impact on lyrical songs, promoting interactions on behalf of the customs and habits of a given linguistic community. Based on oral tradition and linguistic facts, the society of the Saloum in the view of others performs a lyrical historical and cultural narrative to convey messages with such wedding songs. The songs or words of marriage transmit pragmatic meaning and moral, religious, and cultural values. 1.1 *Problem* This article is a pragmatic contribution that aims to discuss the cultural meanings and functions conveyed through song lyrics among the Senegalese people, especially the Saalum community. Thus, two fundamental aspects are highlighted as a traditional aspect from an oral basis and linguistic facts. Otherwise, the language of the wedding songs is essentially based on the oral tradition, leading to making a junction between literature and linguistics. Findings reveal that the majority of Saalum wedding songs focus on motivating the couple, especially, the bride as a pivotal role in this union. An accomplishment that requires the assistance and supervision of parents as mandatories.  ## 2. Method  Pragmatic analysis of linguistic facts underlines the characteristics of wedding songs that convey a meaning specific to the Saalum. Around twenty (20) elderly Saloum women are taken as key informants, performing the songs of which they had extensive knowledge and experience. The process of data collection includes observation, questions, and focus-group discussions too. The study proceeds to present a collection of songs from which each verse will be translated and pragmatically interpreted. 2.1 *Literature Review* The important aspect of wedding songs in the society of Saloum mainly considers social, educational, and traditional issues. Indeed, some works have supported such views with songs for these respective purposes. \"Wedding songs are generally believed among the Hausa to bring about conformity to the approved modes of behavior regarding married life. For example, there are songs that are instructive as they teach the bride to obey and respect her husband, her parents-in-law, and her husband's close kin. Similarly, there are songs that warn the bride to be careful with her co-wives (in case of a polygamous household), and be ready to defend herself from any mischief from them. There are also songs that the bride sings to lament the loss of her girlhood freedom or to praise her intended bridegroom. Likewise, some songs are directed at the would-be husband-in which he is urged to be a good husband by treating his wife fairly and respecting his in-laws (Bichi, & Abdu Yahya, 1986). \"In African values transmission, wedding ceremonies became one of its main functions. During these occasions, life skills and knowledge about married life were shared with the young couple through jangwa songs\" (Mugandani et al., 2016, pp. 1-15).  \"Members of a community engage in group singing as part of organized activities with specific functions, where knowledge is shared through songs\" (Mugandani et al., 2016, pp. 1-15). Many daily social issues are taught and followed thanks to these songs, in which the traditions are ruled in. 2.2 The Oral Basis of *African Wedding Songs* Riggs (2006) describes African marriage as a combination of religious and traditional practices. It is clear that religious marriage ceremonies (Islamic and Christian) also follow traditional practices adopted by communities. Tradition has an important aspect that the orality underlines. Many authors and researchers have marked this traditional importance in African marriage. \"We are Ibos. When we want to marry an Ibo girl, we follow the Ibo custom to connect with the parents.\" This implies a need to take root and embrace the girl's parents. Moreover, the same author points out that Obi Okonkwo, who studied in England and moved to Lagos to work, rejects the weight of the custom that forbids her to marry Clara who is \"Osu\", that is to say, a caste class. \"Osu is like \"leprosy\" in people's minds. So, the strength of tradition imposes all its rigidity (Achebe Ch., 1960, p. 71).  According to Jagua Nana, the heroine of the novel of the same title, her short marriage is an attempt to force her to conform to the customs and traditions of Ogabu (Cyprian Ekwensi, 1961). Indeed, literature has always been a part of the oral basis, leading to putting a connection between theories and orality. With regard to Negro-African literature, a distinction should be made between \"works written in European languages and oral literature that is expressed in African languages\" (Kesteloot, 1981, p. 6). Indeed, traditional African literature is understood mainly by its oral character. It constitutes literature through which speech plays a fundamental role in the transmission of socio-cultural values from one generation to the next. Thus, \"The inexhaustible source of interpretations of the cosmos, beliefs and cults, laws and customs; systems of kinship and alliance; systems of production and distribution of goods; modes of political power and social stratification; ethical and aesthetic criteria; concepts of representations of moral values\" (Kestelot, 2001, p. 13). \"Speech conveys many values in traditional African society\" (Eno Belinga, 1965-19, p. 9). The word remains [\u2026] the priority and majority cultural support par excellence in so far as it expresses its traditional heritage and weaves between past and present generations. This link of continuity and solidarity is without which there is neither history nor civilization (Chevrier, 1986, p. 13). In summary, tradition and customs practice does not exclude anyone regardless of",

All these ideas reflect, among other things, the importance of oral literature, whose study 127 Published by *SCHOLINK INC.* makes a junction with the lyrical songs of marriage, in which semantic characteristics are set.  ## 3. Results  The wedding songs in the Saloum are governed by a playful and moral eloquence in view to the participants and actors. Indeed, women who have experienced these traditional requirements in the sacred unions explain to their younger generation the need to follow their steps and successfully prepare themselves as they did. Those people involved in these cultural practices find that the worshiping conditions should be adapted to social needs. These songs reflect all the devotion that a woman must show to keep her home safe. An extract of the songs is drawn for semantic studies in a glozing corpus.  1.

Since children had been raised under their parents' attention and care, they must understand how to follow their steps. As such, the traditional realities made people prepare for their marital life while referring to the elders' instructions. The couples have reached the level of wise behavior, especially, the women who care about the bonds of marriage. Saalum marriage like other communities has taken a way for people to perpetuate their bloodline, but also the sacrality of bounding links into families and relatives, while keeping rigorously these links. Indeed, the pragmatic aspects reveal that women are guiding the relatives' connection for wider links relations. Those who are lost with the nature of the relationship among relatives refer to the women who guide them. Many roles and ideas are drawn from these songs and the meaning has been pragmatically interpreted. 4.1 Women as Hardship-Bearers 2. Da\u00f1u lay naxee ba y\u00f2bbu la, soo demee yaadi rooti taxanee. *\"Signare Kamara, it's not because of a loss that you as a mother are crying, when you marry your* daughter\" 3.

The words point out a sad mother for marrying her daughter with no choice. In fact, the tears of a mother do not only mean giving her daughter in marriage as a loss but also the awareness of the sacrifice she will do in her household. In fact, women undergo chores in their homes to provide services to the members of the in-laws' family in all situations. Whether the sun is hot or it rains, sooner or later, the good African woman is always the one who faces these moments.   4.2 *Women as Fertile Ressources* 6. Fonkal sa njureel doom, sa alal, boo fonkee nj\u00e0boot buur Laahu teral la. \"Respect and care for your descendants, your wealth, If you love children, God will care for you.\" Indeed, based on kinship guidance, is noted in the wedding songs that women hold main roles in the societies' settings and rules. The supremacy of the family is held by the woman thanks to her devotion to fertility. Her ability to produce her descendants within her marriage is the main issue of her strengths.   Thus, the song illustrates the sacrifice she must face to reach such a level of fertility. Allowing her to rest in an estimated period, while gaining respect and appreciation of her in-laws. \"In Africa, The reproductive capacity of women is a major assurance of permanence and stability in marriage, in the family, and in the clan. This vision is manifested in the characters of 'Idu and Adiewere' who were entirely devoted to their union. Their happiness appears as ecstasy but unfortunately slows down by an absence of fertility\" (Nwapa, & Flora, 1970). Nwapa lets us understand that in the African tribe, motherhood holds a prominent role, and prior is given to submissive and perfect mothers. We understand from these lyric words, the faith of a heavy destiny in the lives of women who bear such responsibility. 4.3 *Women as Family Bonds* 7. Fonkal sa sey doom sa moomeel, boo nekee jeegu puso yaadi defar. \"Take care of your household as your ownership my daughter, If you become a relative bonder, you will be the wellness-maker.\" The song reveals that despite fertility as a core purpose in marriages, the behavior of the wives is considered to be the main principle to link the in-law families. Women are devoted to their kinship as well as one of their in-laws, due to the descendants she cares for. Women who will care for their children will care for their in-laws too. This is why, through these wedding songs, prior is given to women leadership as social characters. Otherwise, the woman holds a great responsibility to keep the two families united while ensuring good relations between them. The wife has an outstanding role in family decision-fulfillment. Indeed, the wives are mainly implicated. In the Saalum community, the goals of the wedding songs judge the personality of the women based on their actions. Indeed, the woman is the bride who leaves her home to join her husband and in-laws home to care for the alliance of both families. It is thus understood that women more often return to neighborly families and relatives to strengthen ties of blood and sometimes brotherhood. 4.4 *Women as House Managers* 8. Jagal, jagal doom nga jagal, bu jagee nga am lu leer ci jagal.   \"Restore restore my daughter restore, If you restore breaking you will possess bright things.\" Wedding songs are considered the",

        "sentence_chunk": "art to dance when women illustrate the ability to move and create social attractiveness. Such facts would indicate a willingness to impose themselves and manage what belongs to them in their household. Thus, such strategies would participate in the good household and husbands' management and similarly transmit the skills to her property. Apart from human resources, women generally hold economic activities in their households as livestock, agriculture, and trading. Management skills are helpful for them in such a business.   Economically, the women who own cattle learn to manage them with the aim of creating and expanding wealth. The words teach women not only to care for their owners but also to be able to restore any of this which would fall into breaking. 4.5 Marriage As a Means of Priesthood and Education 5. Waaye na nga s\u00e0lloo ngor ak jom ca waar wa, S\u00e0llool ngor ak jom ca waar wa. *\"But, put up with dignity and self-respect in the issue,* Put up with dignity and self-respect.\" The priesthood of marriage in the Saalum context concerns main women as union savers and family carers. An alleged judgment against the woman in her devotion would justify the neglect of her property. This implies that eventual mistakes would be the cause of the disunity of the in-laws' families, as well as her children. Besides, obedience also becomes an important character of the woman to accomplish her dogma. If a woman proves evidence of obedience, she will make satisfied with the choice made upon her. From this submission, love or desire would be based on a target union, conceived by parents or elders. Marriage, therefore, requires patience, support, and motivation to succeed in such a priesthood union. Considering the above arguments, sustaining the problem of this research paper; it must be known that the involvement of parents in traditional marriages plays a fundamental role in their success as well as their failure. The marriage of an African woman, whatever the conditions, is bound to the instructions of the parents. Indeed, parents are taken as the backbone of the union of their children. This is why girls mostly accept the choice of their parents with no objection. At last, one might notice that obedience and self-denial are fundamental characteristics of housewives. This is the reality that all young African women, as part of families of standard morality must take into account. From this point of view, marriage becomes a priesthood that requires a good educational and moral basis to assume it. The household reconstruction is based on moral and cultural principles adapted to social norms, which often excludes the desire to love before getting engaged in a couple. One mere remain connected to social realities to make progress in such unions. This is the main idea that wedding songs give, although they hold different themes. The semantic aspect is set as a topic issue, leading to emphasize the song's message, transmitted from the old to the young generation in Wolof society, especially in the Saloum community. Thus, the songs of marriage in such a context are purely motivational and conservative, and the words are facts of evidence. All this knowledge is taught thanks to the songs' Semantics, leading to enriching cultural diversity and traditional beliefs within the community of Saalum. Thus, the Semantics of the wedding songs bear messages, wisdom, and sacrifice toward couples, especially women. Pragmatic analysis of songs has led to conveying messages, educating young people, expanding knowledge in future generations, securing social relationships, and managing resources. We understand some basic virtues behind these unions planned by old people to care for their living and beliefs.  This old practice of wedding songs has basically founded traditional societies with human civilizations. Similar to neighboring cultures, the wedding songs govern the will and parental decisions. This implies much responsibility and motivation towards the concerned couples. However, this pragmatic sense of traditional marriage embodied in songs does not exclude contentment in some other cases. Indeed, it exists through these unions couples who mutually loved each other and receive the parents' care for their unions. Some people engage naturally in a couple of relationships among relatives or neighbors without having one's parents' arrangement. But parents are always ready to assist such unions for success. Such facts lead to understanding the crucial decisions of parents in these unions, who aim to maintain family relationships, ethnicity, or social belonging. This tendency to accept a conjoint for the purpose of maintaining or strengthening family or ethnic relations may reverse depending on moods, faults, or even misconduct of the couple. Culturally, sacredness is taken into account to solve any eventual issues raised by the unions. 4.6 *The Study Objectives* The issues of cultural identity and beliefs are set in the African world where their practices are bound to social norms and realities. This study shows a short link between religion and culture as being essential parts of human existence. Indeed, through songs and other oral basis, people are mainly bound to such cultural beliefs, while preserving their religious instructions in the management of marriages in traditional societies. These pragmatic meanings of the wedding songs have given wide aspects in African civilization, based on moral principles as well as values. Moreover, this topic issues contributes to cultural diversity, allowing people from different geographic areas to apprehend other cultures around the world. It also expands cultural knowledge, leading to a better understanding of people's beliefs within different communities.   ## 4.7 Findings  African people have developed some beliefs and practices based on tradition to perpetuate them. We expect from this topic issue a desire to give women the leadership of self-engagement in couples, without hampering their happiness. Indeed, some developed ideas around the issues of marriage as being only sacerdotal and donation are mainly developed in tradition to charge women. Therefore, marriage is seen as a commitment of women who endeavor in their household. Besides, the responsibility given to women as union carers and savers thanks to their devotion should be shared by husbands and in-laws as well. Many theories led to the understanding that the failure of marriage in Africa is under the responsibility of women so that, they put up with all situations. As a result, some ideas and thoughts were developed in traditional African society about the dedication and sacrifice of women to save arranged or sponsored marriages. Among these theories, are cited proverbs, riddles, tales, songs, etc. which this topic has treated. Thus, the community established songs, likely to characterize the feeling of grief, proudly expressed to manage hardship and keep the tradition. These criteria of marriage, although considered as irresistible to some, are perceived as the foundations of a social responsibility, conveyed by responsible people.  ## 5. Conclusion  The African Oral Tradition has much cultural diversity due to the facts of social norms related to the historical context of the African marriage. Wedding songs convey particular messages. The importance of such a practice would justify the adoption of traditional and societal values, namely, respect for elders, their speech, respectability, personality, and wisdom. Thus, songs have a crucial role in building societal values, creating relations, educating young people, etc. based on conventional rules. Apart from marriage themes, other topic issues have been raised from the same context. The topic issue has thus considered wide aspects of the marriage in which the pragmatics reveals through such song.   ## Acknowledgments  I am grateful to the respondents from Saalum areas who made this topic sense, and the same to the English Section Staff in the Numeric University for discussing issues around this topic. This has facilitated its fulfillment. I am thanking my colleague Dr. Jean Christophe Faye for his research",

A variety of methodologies are used, including an individual questionnaire (n=2,394 men aged 20 and above), a survey of ethnographic evidence, and participant observation. By comparing nuptiality between Kenyan and Tanzanian Maasai, this study examines marriage among the Maasai in particular and rural sub-Saharan African populations undergoing socio-economic change in general. Maasai men marry later, on average, than the national average in both Kenya and Tanzania, and the age at first marriage appears to be declining. Relative to national levels, polygynous marriages account for a significantly higher proportion of Maasai marriages. Country-level differences in entry into and type of (monogamous or polygynous) marriage are described and explanations sought. The Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania are arguably the best-known pastoralist population in the world, and the current study represents an opportunity to update and review the body of evidence linking pastoralism with polygyny. Linkages between socio-economic divergence and nuptiality are identified, with specific reference to uptake of formal education. Changes in marriage are a \"ready barometer\" (Goodkind, 1996:718) of change in society. Comparative analyses reveal rising age at first marriage for both men and women (Westoff *et al*, 1994) and a relative decline in the prevalence of *de jure* polygyny (Timaeus and Reynar, 1998), although much heterogeneity remains between and within countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, the median age at marriage has risen from 26.2 years among men now in their late 20s compared with 24.2 years among men now in their early 40s (AGI, 2003). Nuptiality patterns reflect demographic characteristics (including population age-sex composition), economic factors (including both direct costs such as bridewealth and indirect opportunity costs), and socio-cultural influences, and each of these factors is unlikely to operate independently of the others. Demographic studies of nuptiality have tended to focus on women, not least because of the strong association with fertility. For example, the large literature about polygyny is almost entirely centred on the relationship between females in polygynous marriages and the effect on fertilityi. Marriage involves men and women as partners, yet there has been an \"empirical neglect of men\", with men studied \"often as accessories to women rather than as objects of study\" (Greene & Biddlecom, 2000: 81) in demography. This study compares and contrasts recent and contemporary nuptiality among Maasaiii men of Kenya and Tanzania, and represents the first cross-national comparable data set on Maasai marriage. By focusing on one ethnic group, this study acknowledges the complex nature of marriage, and its variability between different cultural settings. Indeed, Van de Walle suggests, \"nuptiality data are most rich, detailed and useful when they are provided on one particular subpopulation of a country\" (1993:xx). Research conducted at individual and household levels is best able to provide valid and reliable answers to questions about the relationship between society and marriage. Traditional views of the Maasai as a purely pastoralist subsistence population, with low levels of integration in regional and national economies have increasingly been revised. In recent decades Maasai have been influenced, amongst other factors, by national governments, formal education provision, occupation diversification and integration within the monetised economy. At the broadest scale, there is socio-economic divergence between Kenyan and Tanzanian Maasai. Maasai in Tanzania continue to live a far more traditional lifestyle, one that is much less interwoven with the processes of modernisation, compared with their Kenya neighbours (Coast, 2002). Levels of education (both male and female) and participation in paid employment are significantly higher in Kenya relative to Tanzania. Reliance upon livestock as the source of subsistence production is much lower in Kenya,   and these socio-economic differences are reflected in material proxies of wealth, such as possession of a modern (metal-roofed) dwelling (Galaty and Bonte, 1992; Igoe and Brockington, 1999; Fratkin, 2001; Moris 1981; Rutten 1992; Lane 1996, 1998; Brockington, 2002). By comparing nuptiality between Kenyan and Tanzanian Maasai, this study highlights change and continuity in marriage among the Maasai in particular and rural sub-Saharan African populations undergoing socio-economic change in general. This study represents the first cross-national comparable data set on Maasai marriage and the study design therefore broadly resembles that of a natural experiment, a valuable framework for analysis. It is an approach worth pursuing because, to echo the words of Hill and Randall, \"Natural experiments in the human sphere are not all that common and the chance to look at the behaviour of the same ethnic group living in different circumstances\u2026is too valuable to waste\" (1985:39). Three key research questions are addressed. Firstly, what is the contemporary marriage situation in Kenya and Tanzania for Maasai men, including entry into marriage and type of marriage (monogamous or polygynous)? Secondly, are there significant differences in entry into marriage and the type of marriage between Maasai men in Kenya and Tanzania? Thirdly, is there a relationship between background socioeconomic factors (including education and livelihood) and entry into and type of marriage? The relationship between livelihood and polygyny, with specific reference to pastoralist societies, has been a recurrent theme (for example, Lesthaeghe et al, 1989) in the study of marriage changes in sub- Saharan Africa. The Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania are arguably the best-known pastoralist population in the world (Spear, 1993: 1), and the current study represents an opportunity to update and review the body of information linking pastoralism with polygyny.   ## Data And Methods  A variety of methodologies is used, including a questionnaire, a survey of ethnographic evidence, and participant observation. A single round demographic survey (SRDS) was conducted between October 1997 and May 1998. The absence of complete and up-to-date sampling frames prevented systematic scientific sampling of the population. Study sites were chosen specifically to reflect the range of experience of Maasai, a predominantly rural population. Within each of these study sites, all households were enumerated, with a response rate of 98%.   The SRDS collected data on 2,394 men aged 20 and above, at three sites using a standardised questionnaire administered at the household level by locally recruited and trained Maasai enumerators. Nuptiality data include current marital status, age at first marriage, and number of wives. Socioeconomic data were based on free-responses to questions about occupation (which were subsequently coded), observations of material goods and housing, and responses to questions about livestock ownership. The survey represents the first cross-border directly comparable set of information on current Maasai marriage patterns. The strength of the survey data presented here is their cross-national comparability",

        "sentence_chunk": "and size. The major limitation is the shallowness of information that can be gathered using a survey, and ethnographic and case study evidence are used to complement the quantitative data. The participant observation described in this study is best described as \"passive\", that is, the researcher is present at the scene of action but does not participate or interact with other people to any great extent.   ## Cultural Context  Marriage is traditionally a process rather than an event for Maasai; the representation of marriage as a process rather than single event has long been recognised in studies of nuptiality in sub-Saharan Africa (Bledsoe and Pison, 1994; Meekers, 1992; Van de Walle, 1968; Ware, 1977). The Maasai have a strong division of responsibilities, roles and labour between age groups and sexes and there are regional variations in both the nature of the life stages and the rituals or customs associated with them. This description will be limited to an overview of the major phases and will not refer to the welldocumented rituals associated with them (Spear and Waller, 1993; Spencer, 1988). Any consideration of Maasai male social roles must place at its core the age set system. This is composed of a group of contemporaries, united by their communal circumcision, which takes place between the ages roughly of 15 and 20 years. Circumcised young men are warriors (sing. *murran*) and are unable to occupy the same house as their fathers. Historically, men who were still *murran* could not marry, as this was seen as the prerogative of elders. In contemporary Kenyan Maasailand, however, this chronological ability to marry appears to be reducing in importance. For example, the author was present at two wedding ceremonies where the groom was a *murran*. Men cease to be murran when the subsequent age set is created, and become junior elders.   Ideally, a man should marry once he has become an elder. In practical terms, a man can only marry when he is economically secure in order that he can establish an independent household. Economic security is normally defined in terms of livestock, although the diversification of Maasai livelihoods means that livestock is no longer the only measure of a man's economic self-sufficiency. Perhaps the strictest rule relating to marriage partners is that the husband may not be of the same age-set as the wife's father, making the \"ideal wife\" the daughter of a man who is two age sets older than the prospective husband. Marriage between Maasai and non-Maasai has been widely reported, for example, reference to marriage between Maasai and agriculturists (Kikuyu in Kenya and Chagga in Tanzania) appears frequently (Spear and Waller, 1993), however this study is restricted only to marriages between Maasai.   ## Results And Analyses  The following sections draw upon the quantitative data from the SRDS, supported by case studies highlighting individual agency and societal structure. Where appropriate, evidence from extant ethnographies is incorporated.   ## Current Nuptiality  Table 1 shows the percentage distribution of male respondents aged above 19 years, by marital status. Marriage is almost universal, with 1 per cent of men reporting themselves as never-married above age 70. Because of the high levels of polygyny, especially with increasing age, men are very unlikely to be widowed (although one or more wives may have died). For example, it is only above age 69 that a non-negligible proportion (5.0%) of men is reported as being widowers. Very low levels of marriage instability are reported for men, also because of the influence of polygyny. That is, if a man is polygynously married, and one wife leaves him, he is still reported as being currently married, even though his wife will be reported as separated. Once married, men will probably spend the rest of their lives within a marriage (albeit with a changing wife composition).   Formal marriage dissolution is very rare among the Maasai. It should be noted that there is no directly translated word in Maaiii for divorce. Only 0.2% of men were reported as divorced or separated in the current study. The reasons for this are threefold. Firstly, the wife's parents may have to pay back all or part of the brideprice. Secondly, given the strong affinal relationship that develops between the two   families (wife's and husband's), such a break-up has ramifications far greater than the individual couple. This aspect is summarised by Mitzlaff, \"As marriage is not seen as a matter between two individuals it cannot be dissolved by these two partners\" (1988:148). Thirdly, a wife (unless breastfeeding) is unable to take her children with her permanently, as children belong to the patriline. The divorcing of a wife by a husband has historically been referred to in the ethnographic literature in the cases of sterile women (Hollis, 1910; Jacobs, 1970; Llewelyn-Davis, 1974). Relative to national levels, polygynous marriages account for a significantly higher proportion of Maasai marriages, accounting for 32.4% and 28.7% of all Maasai marriages in Kenya and Tanzania, respectively. In the most recent (1998) Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey (DHS, 1998), 9.8% of all currently married men married men aged 15-54 were in polygynous union, down from 11.6% in 1993. In Tanzania, 15% of currently married men aged 15-59 were reported as being in polygynous unions (DHS, 1996).   ## Age At First Marriage  Direct and indirect estimates of male age at first marriage indicate a higher age at first marriage in Tanzania, relative to Kenya. Table 2 presents selected measures of reported age at first marriage by sex and country for all ever-married men.   There are significant country-level differences in reported age at first marriage for men. An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare the means age at first marriage for Kenyan men and Tanzanian men. There was a significant difference (t=-11.934, p = 0.000) in mean age at first marriage for Kenyan men (M = 25.56, SD = 5.97) and Tanzanian men (M = 29.38, SD = 6.76). The magnitude of the differences in the mean was moderately large (eta squared = 0.08). Maasai men marry later, on average, than the national average in both Kenya and Tanzania. Tanzania mainland rural median age at first marriage is 24.7 years (men aged 25-59) (DHS 1996 Table 5.5), and Kenya rural median age at first marriage is 24.8 years (men aged 25-54) (DHS 1998 Table 5.3).   By examining difference in mean age at reported first marriage for men above 35 yearsiv, it is possible to explore whether there is evidence of changing age at entry into marriage over time. These results suggest that there is a significant difference in age at first marriage across the different age groups. An inspection of the mean ranks for the groups shows that the older age groups have the highest age at first marriage, with the younger group reporting the lowest (Chi2 = 118.3, p=.000, df=9). It is possible, however, that reporting of age at first marriage is affected by the age of the respondent, with older men in all likelihood reporting on events that happened relatively longer ago, introducing the possibility of distortion of reporting.   ## Polygyny  Both the causes and effects of polygyny have been studied extensively, in a variety of sub-Saharan African settings (Romaniuc, 1988; Pison, 1986; Pebley & Mbugua, 1989; Lesthaeghe *et al,* 1988, 1989b; Timaeus and Reynar, 1998). The supports for polygyny have been associated with a variety of \"macro-level factors\" (Timaeus and Reynar, 1998:146), including: kinship groups that share a common ancestor (especially patrilineal groups); societies where women undertake most of the subsistence agriculture; when a large family provides both labour and physical security; where women engage extensively in trade (Lesthaeghe *et al*, 1989b); in societies with limited social stratification (Clignet, 1970); and, in societies where traditional belief systems rather than formal religion are dominant. Polygyny is widely reported in ethnographic literature on Maasai (Spencer, 1988; Spear and Waller, 1993; Llewellyn-Davies, 1978; Mitzlaff, 1988; Fosbrooke, 1948),",

        "sentence_chunk": "however few substantive data exist. Mitzlaff's (1988) data are the only quantified examples of Maasai polygyny from the ethnographic literature. Based on her Tanzanian data (n=217), it is calculated that 52.6% of currently married men were in polygynous marriages and on average there were 2.7 wives per polygynist. Graph 1 shows clearly the influence of age upon entry into a polygynous union.   ## Graph 1 About Here  Up to age 34, most married men are in monogamous unions, with a relatively small percentage of men entering a polygynous union before age 35. Men continue to acquire further wives throughout their married life (Table 3), with the majority of men aged between 70-79 years having more than two wives. It must be noted that any distinction between polygyny and monogamy is potentially misleading, as all polygynous marriages begin as monogamous marriages (Ezeh, 1997; Gage-Brandon, 1992). The description of polygyny for the Maasai is reported here using the schema from Timaeus and Reynar (1998). Overall, levels of polygyny prevalence and intensity vary very little between Kenya and Tanzania (Table 4), and the mean number of wives per polygynously married man (w) is not significantly different between Kenya and Tanzania. Nearly half (46%) of all currently married men are in polygynous unions, and the average number of wives per polygynist is 2.8. It is important to note, however, that significant percentages of men in both Kenya and Tanzania are still in monogamous marriage by the age of 60 (24% and 34%, respectively).   The influence of polygyny on spousal age difference for existing marriages is clear, ranging from 10 years for first wives to 32 years for wives ranked five and above. The highest reported spousal age difference was 63 years.   ## Socio-Economic Context And Nuptiality  How are socio-economic background factors related to age at entry into, and type of, marriage for Maasai men? Two key socio-economic factors are examined here: education and livelihood. Data on education are based on reported years of formal education (excluding adult education), adjusted for country-level differences in the length of primary education. Direct data on education are relatively straightforward as men are unable to marry while still at school, so a man's retrospectively reported level of education is achieved prior to his marrying. Livelihood data are more complex, and are based on a combination of open-ended responses to the question \"What things do you do to earn a living?\", allowing for multiple responses that were then coded, and combined with dichotomous responses about livestock ownership. Because the data on livelihoods are cross-sectional, they do not reflect changes in livelihoods that may have occurred since a man married. Thus, it is possible for a man's livelihood to have changed significantly since his entry into marriage. Further, it is possible that some livelihood indicators are dependent upon marriage, for example, the household might have begin to cultivate following the marriage because the wife was skilled at cultivating. It is reasonable to assume, however, that a man who is currently reported as a pastoralist was also a pastoralist at the time of his marriage. Literature on the effect of education and age at first marriage is widespread and unanimous: at the societal level, increased education is associated with an increase in first age at marriage (Caldwell, 1982; McCarthy, 1982; McDonald, 1985; Weinberger, 1987; Lesthaeghe *et al*, 1989; Westoff *et al*, 1994; Stambach, 1996; AGI 2003). For Maasai men in both countries there is a statistically significant relationship between reported age at first marriage and education (Table 5). However, the direction of the relationship is opposite to that expected: men with more education report lower ages at first marriage.   These results are contrary to the generalised pattern of rising age at marriage with rising levels of education reported elsewhere. Explanations for this counterintuitive relationship and the interaction between education and livelihood diversification are explored further below. Case Study 1 (although undoubtedly unusual) highlights how education can influence male entry into marriage.   ## Case Study 1 About Here  There are, of course, issues with only examining those men who have already married, as this censors those men who have yet to marry. Never-married men are likely to be younger and hence more likely to have been to school than their older counterparts, as participation in education has increased significantly among Maasai in the last few decades (Coast, 2002). It is also important to acknowledge that there is likely to be an interaction between level of formal education and validity of age reporting in completed years. Using a broad dichotomous category of male occupation - pastoralist (including agropastoralist) and non-pastoralist - there is evidence of a statistically significant relationship between age at first marriage and occupation for men in Kenya (Z=-2.2, p=0.029), with (agro)pastoralist men marrying at older ages than non-pastoralist. The relationship between occupation and age at first marriage was not significant for Tanzania. Much has been written about the effect of female education on polygyny (Lesthaeghe *et al*, 1989; Hayase and Liaw, 1997). Given the patriarchal nature of Maasai society and the low levels of female education, it is more instructive to examine levels of polygyny by male education. To quote Basu \"analyses [of the education-marriage-fertility relationship].... assume that while there is something special about the educated woman, there is nothing special about the educated man\" (1999:269). The prevalence of polygyny decreases sharply with completed primary education in both Kenya and Tanzania (Table 6), a relationship that is statistically significantv.   What is it about better-educated men that makes them less likely to acquire more than one wife? It is possible that there is a reduction in the level of paternal influence over a man who has been well educated, especially if the father has not been educated. This may make it easier for the man to refuse to marry until he wants to (Case Study 2).   ## Cast Study 2 About Here  For a pastoralist man, more wives mean more children and extended networks of reciprocity. Drought, livestock diseases and raiding are the major causes of livestock loss among pastoralist communities, and larger herd owners are better able to deal with (and survive) such crises. The transfer of bridewealth to the man's in-laws enhances his social network and future security. However, Lesthaeghe *et al* (1989), using a cross-cultural survey based on Murdock's Ethnographic Atlas (1967), argue that a pastoralist society is one in which women are rendered economically unimportant, as men control and organise the means of production, the result of which is reduced levels of polygyny. Table 7 consolidates the literature on the relationship between polygyny and pastoralism in order to re-assess Lesthaeghe *et al's* hypothesis.   The results summarised in Table 7 suggest no clear relationship between pastoralism and polygyny. The review shows that the importance of polygyny varies greatly both between and within pastoral groups, with evidence pointing towards higher levels of polygyny in east compared with west Africa.   Roth's (1994) study of the Toposa agropastoralists in Sudan would appear to be the one exception to this pattern. Relative to other pastoralist groups, the levels of polygyny among the Maasai are relatively high (Table 8), and there are no significant country-level differences in the mean number of wives per polygynist by different livelihood.   However, the prevalence (p) and intensity (w) of polygyny decrease with diversification away from a \"pure\" pastoralist occupation, in both Kenya and Tanzania. Because the socio-economic, demographic and cultural variables affecting nuptiality are so inter-dependent, the reasons why pastoralist-only households have higher levels of polygyny are complex. For example, there is a clear link between livelihood diversification and levels of",

In order to explore in more depth the hypothesis that pastoralism and other contextual factors affect whether a marriage is polygynous or monogamous, logistic regression was used to analyse factors associated with being in a monogamous marriage. Because acquisition of wives continues throughout a man's lifetime, age was controlled for by introducing it as a continuous variable into the regression. The dependent variable in the logistic regression was whether a man was in a monogamous relationship. The results of the logistic regression are shown in Table 9. A range of socio-economic factors is incorporated, including proxies for wealth based on material goods ownership. The model allows for the testing of two hypotheses generated by the ethnographic literature. Firstly, is spousal subfecundityvi an important predictor of a polygynous marriage? Secondly, is the broader multihousehold composition important, namely, is the man head of his own household, or is he still a member of his father's household (and thus still subject to the influence of his father)?  Characteristics that were significantly more likely to be associated with monogamy in both Kenya and Tanzania were the level of male education, and whether the man was head of his own household. Men with at least some education were significantly more likely to be in monogamous relationships than men with no education (Kenya: odds ratio 2.3; Tanzania: odds ratio 2.1). It should be noted that the likelihood of a man being in a monogamous relationship with completed primary education was insignificant in both Kenya and Tanzania, although the direction of the relationship was the same as for men with incomplete primary education. Men who were heads of their own household (rather than members of a household headed by an older or more senior male) were highly (p<0.001) significantly more likely to be in monogamous rather than polygynous relationships, a relationship that was especially strong in Tanzania (Kenya: odds ratio 2.3; Tanzania: odds ratio 6.2). Several variables were significant in only one country. In Tanzania the presence of a subfecund wife significantly (p<.001) decreased the likelihood that a man would be in a monogamous relationship (odds ratio 0.4). Tanzanian men in the lower middle wealth category were significantly more likely to be monogamous (odds ratios 2.6). It is worth noting that while the other two wealth categories were not significant in their association with monogamy, the direction of the odds ratios suggests that the likelihood of monogamy decreases with wealth. Men living in households reporting cultivation were significantly more likely to be in monogamous relationships (odds ratio 2.2). In Kenya, monogamous men were significantly more likely not to own livestock (odds ratio 5.1) and significantly less likely to be living in a traditionally built home (odds ratio 0.6).   ## Discussion  Marriage is a social institution, associated with socio-economic, cultural, and demographic variables at a variety of levels. Issues of kinship, lineage, property ownership and transfer, residence, social and political power, together with social and biological reproduction, are all closely bound up with marriage. However, \"the nature and rationale of the mechanisms linking society and marriage are poorly understood\" (Van de Walle, 1985:110). This account of Maasai marriage serves to substantiate the ethnographic evidence, demonstrating universality of marriage for men, relatively high levels of polygyny and very low levels of formal divorce. The age at entry into marriage is significantly lower for Kenyan Maasai relative to Tanzanian, although once married there are insignificant differences in the level of polygyny between the two countries. Timaeus and Reynar suggest, \"It has become a tradition for papers on polygyny in sub- Saharan Africa to conclude with a statement that the institution is alive and well\" (1998:161). Whilst demonstrating the continued importance of polygynous marriages in contemporary Maasai society, this study shows that the likelihood of being in a monogamous marriage rather than a polygynous one was   significantly associated with several socio-economic characteristics, including education, practice of cultivation, ownership of livestock, and level of wealth. Background socio-demographic factors such as whether a man was the head of his own household or whether there was a wife who was subfecund were also significantly associated with the likelihood of being in a monogamous marriage. The earlier entry into marriage for Kenyan Maasai suggests that traditional constraints on entry into marriage (for example, being a *murran*) are being eroded. This conclusion is reinforced by the results of the logistic regression, which highlights that changing socio-economic factors including the non-ownership of cattle and \"modern\" housing is significantly associated with being monogamously married. Education is a powerful and frequently used proxy for socio-economic change. The case studies in particular demonstrate that institutions (both cultural and socio-political) can have highly individualised effects on nuptiality behaviour. A similar conclusion is reached by Madhavan and Bledsoe in their study of fertility management in the Gambia, concluding that such an approach \"offers a marked departure from the standard demographic notions that institutions allow little or no individual agency in traditional societies\" (2001:451). Analyses by education for the Maasai suggest a complex picture, where participation in education for men is associated with a lower age at first marriage combined with a lower propensity to enter a polygynous marriage. The relationship between a lower age at first marriage with increased levels of education is counter to the global trend of more education leading to rising age at entry into marriage. However, when the implications of increased education for livelihoods diversification are examined, the picture becomes clearer. Educated men are much less likely to be wholly concerned with a traditional subsistence agropastoralist lifestyle, and are more likely to diversify socio-economically. A move away from a traditional livelihood represents more than simply how a man supports his household; it also represents a wider move towards \"modernisation\", and an outlook that is less likely to be governed by considerations of parental control. For example, an educated man is more likely to be head of his own household at a younger age, relative to a non-educated man who is more likely to remain within his father's household even once he is married. The educated man is going to be less influenced by traditional considerations of \"correct\" behaviour, including the need to acquire many cattle before marrying, and to have more than one wife. Younger and more educated men tend to want to send all of their children to school, not just one or two, an increasingly expensive undertaking. More wives mean greater total numbers of children, reducing the likelihood of them all going to school. The cross-national study of marriage patterns for one ethnic group presented here is a powerful tool for examining the role of influences at a variety of scales on nuptiality. Country-level differences in socioeconomic change are reflected in nuptiality outcomes, although not always in the expected direction. Further socio-economic change among the Maasai is already underway, including rural-urban migration (Homewood *et al*, 2001) and rising levels of formal religion, both factors that are likely to have implications for marriage change in the future.   | Age group      | n          | Currently married   | Previously married   | Never married   |     |     |      | |----------------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------| | Monogamous     | Polygynous | Divorced            | Separated            | Widowed         |     |     |      | | All men  20-29 | 1004       | 26.7                | 4.9                  |",

He had been in trouble with the local administrators, for not sending any of his children to school, despite having the financial means to do so. When Daniel was 13, and still attending school, his father arranged a marriage for him. The marriage was to a girl slightly older than Daniel (a very unusual situation). Because no married person can attend school, Daniel's father saw the marriage of Daniel as a way of defying local administrators. Daniel's father resorted to the use of a traditional healer (*laiboni*) in order that the local administrators would not pursue him for his actions. Daniel himself was uninterested in marrying at that age, and became a full-time *murran* for nearly two years. During that time, his new wife stayed with her mother-in-law until Daniel returned permanently to the homestead. It is highly unlikely that Daniel's father would have wanted Daniel to marry at such a young age if it had not been for his desire to remove Daniel from school. Aged 34, Daniel is now a grandfather.   Case Study 2 Albert is a 31-year-old Maasai man living in Kajiado District (Kenya). He completed secondary school education, and then went on to do a car mechanics apprenticeship in an urban area. His parents had \"booked\" two Maasai girls for him to marry. He refused to marry either girl, having decided that he wanted to marry Mary, a Maasai woman who had also completed secondary school education. After marrying Mary, Albert was disowned by his family and two of his brothers married the girls his parents had chosen for him. Albert and Mary live in a traditional multi-household homestead, and have two children (aged 5 and 2). Albert stated that he would never have more than one wife because of the costs of educating many children.   ![27_image_0.png](27_image_0.png)  A.G.

SMAMs provide a synthetic estimate of the mean age at first marriage, derived from the proportion of each age group not yet married. SMAMs should be interpreted with caution as their estimation necessitates assumptions about nuptiality to be made (no differences in mortality and migration according to marital status, no change in marriage patterns in the recent past). Given the assumptions associated with the calculation of SMAMs and the degree of heaping of reported age at first marriage the interpolated median is the best estimate of current patterns of age at first marriage in this context. It must be remembered that these data are based on the reports of individuals who have already married. Therefore, they are subject to censoring bias, especially for the younger age group. That is, those who have yet to marry will do so on average at an older age than those who have already married.   The censoring of reported age at first marriage does not affect either the SMAM or the interpolated median, which makes these measures more useful than the reported age at first marriage for younger age groups.",

In every nation marriage is of the greatest importance for upon it depends the stability of society, and the formation of the family which is the prime source of our earliest ideas that are to remain with us through life.  Amongst such a. people as the Kipsigis there are special reasons why marriage is of more than ordinary importance.  1. As I have pointed out elsewhere, these people believe not only in the immortality of the spirit, but in its reincarna.tion in the family.  Renee the importance of the family as established by marriage. When a child is born a spirit of a deceased relative enters it, usually from the father's clan, but not always; usually the new-comer retains the sex of the spirit, but again not always. This spirit comes voluntarily, nay desires to come; although in speaking of the ceremony at which it is ascertained whieh spirit has coine, they use the word \" call \" as if they decided on the spirit and called it ... , The child usually has the nature of the spmt, I.e. has such a character as the spirit had when previously incarnated in human bodily -form. Grandfather, grandmother, father's brother or sister are those who most commonly come.  It is the urgent desire of every spirit, whether embodied or not i.e. of every person alive or dead, to return again to earth, and ther~ fore it is the greatest disaster to die childless (chemukto).  It need not worry us here that the Kipsigis conception of the human spirit is somewhat different from ours, a point so much emphasised by Levy Bruhl, writing of many primitive people.  In the case of the Kipsigis, the conception of spirit is not 1i0 very widely different from our own, especially if we take into consideration some of the ideas relating to spirit in connection with our religion.  2. Property in live stock corresponds somewhat to European property in land (real estate) in that it is entailed in the family like ma.ny English estates and may not be disposed of in any way, but is ha.nded down from one generation to another for the benefit of the children .. Therefore, just as in some European land-owning families it is more than ordinarily important to have a son and heir, so amongst the Kipsigis, there is the same urgency for a legitimate heir.  3. Anthropologists are rather apt, in focussing their attention on the clan (because it is something foreign to our own practice), to lose sight of the restricted family in the form Europeans have it.  We hear of such tribes as the Masai, amongst whom, apparently, the restricted family hardly exists.  I cannot emphasise too strongly, therefore, that amongst the Kipsigis group of tribes (Nandi, Keyo, etc.) the family is of very great importance. It is natural that the family should be highly developed amongst them, for they do not live in villages, but each married couple nas its own house often far from any others; in fact they dislike being close together. Near the house is often the \" Singgiroynet \u2022\u2022 house where the elder children and young unmarried men sleep.  The parents and children therefore are much thrown together being thus somewhat isolated from the rest of the community, except when in the field or at ceremonies. It is there that the (lhildren's characters are formed, and they learn from parents or other children all they know before they go to the initiation at the age of, say, 15-17. Further, civil Government used (before the advent of British rule) to be based on the ., Kokwet,\" the social unit consisting of families living within reasonable distance of one another, say a couple of miles, irrespective of clan.  Amongst the Kipsigi there is no segregation of clan. Thus the individual family assumed greater importance in everyday affairs though the clan retained its collective responsibility in some major matters.  It is not the purpose of this article to go into details of all the various customs and ceremonies concerned with marriage-it will be sufficient to take a general view of these, picking out for special mention those which are of greatest importance.  EXOGAMY.  Marriage is very strictly exogamous, i.e. a man may not marry It woman in the remotest degree related by blood on the male side, which is to say that he may not marry a woman of his own clan. Even if a clan has become so large as to be subdivided, yet both portions retaining the same \u2022\u2022 totem \" name are regarded as one clan for marriage purposes, though all other clan obligations between the two branches .cease.  It must be mentioned here that a woman takes the clan of her husband when she marries; not only this, but also his generation, even though her father was of the generation after her husband and not before it. He cannot be of the same generation (see below). However, on the female side, remote blood relationship does not prevent marriage; it is not permissible for the descendants of a woman to marry till the \"third generation, i.e. great grand-children of brother and sister. Put thus simply it does not sound very difficult, but in actual practIce the ramifications of relationship are most intricate and are further complicated by two classes of prohibited marriage.  Those who board and lodge or look after initiates during the five months (or even eight months in the case of girls) of initiation are regarded as their parents and are always addressed by the terms father or mother by these initiation children. One might compare them to God-parents and God-children. Unless special precautions are purposely taken these God-children are regarded for purposes of marriage just as if they were true children and the rules of exogamy apply to their descendants, both in the male and female line.  Finally, there is what one may term exogamy of generationthat is, one may not marry the children of a man of the same generation, irrespective of the age of the children or their mothers. One may marry the children of a man of senior or junior generation.  From this arise rules as to what houses one may sleep in, and this is particularly important on a journey, for one must disclose one's own generation and ascertain that of the people of the house, for one may only sleep in the house of men of one's own generation, though if there are no women, one may sleep in other houses provided one does not t!lleepin the bed-place. I mention this because it has sometimes occurred that a gang of men on road work from a distant district perhaps arriving late in the day, have been told to quarter themselves on the strange district; it becomes obvious at once when one knows these strict rules that it is it not such an easy matter as it may appear to a European unacquainted with their customs.  ## Age Of Marriage.  Having seen whom one may marry, we may consider the various steps in marriage and what they mean.  All girls are married as soon as they come forth from the Initiation, though the marriage is not consummated until the girl with the advice of her mother decides that she is ready to \"cook for\" her husband.  Men marry at any age, according to inclination and property. An only son, especially if the father is dead, marries as soon as he comes out of initiation, in order that the chance of the family dying out may be minimized.  ## The Proposal--\" Kegoyta Toga.\"  While yet the girls are in the initiation the first step is for the father of the prospective bridegroom to pay a ceremonial visit to the father of the girl he desires for his son. It is, of course, frequently the -son who tells his father whom he wishes to marry. He talks with the father and mother of the girl and offers merely one cow. This cow is not a real offer, neither does the man expect an answer. They merely discuss suitability according to clan, generation, etc.  After a few days he makes a second visit when the girl's father discloses by his behaviour whether he is willing to consider the pro-  posal. If he is, the man returns a third time, usually with his wifEl, and they speak of property, of the character of the son, and his capacity to keep a wife and children, after handing over the ,. presen- tation \" cattle, which are",

        "sentence_chunk": "offered at this meeting without being seen.  On a fourth and last occasion the man goes again with his wife, or his wife may even go alone. The number of \" presentation\" cattle is finally decided, and the man or his wife (or both if they are together) is anointed by the father of the proposed bride.  ## ,Tog'Apkoyta.  This whole process is referred to as \" Kebendi Koyta \"-\" onlJt goes to the giving away or presentation,' ~ and the cattle, sheep, and goats so offered are called\" Tog'ap Koyta,\" i.e. the gift cattle or the presentation cattle.  ## \" Kejut Njor.\"  Next the accepted suiter, dressed in a specially fine cloak, usually of monkey skins, and carrying a special walking stick, goes with a.  friend, \" best man,\" as we might say, to the house of his future father-in-law to the ceremony called\" Kejut Njor,\" which means to enter Njor. Njor is actually that half of a house which is on the east side of a line from the door to the fire. It is always associated with \" Sanik,\" i.e. relations by marriage. In some clans there is a hidden door in the wall (called\" Kurg'ap san \"-the door of the relations by marriage) opened on this occasion, by which the prospective son-in-law enters. The phrase means\" to enter on the east of the house,\" that is to enter the house as a relation by marriage. Sitting on that side of the house the young man and his companion confirm to his fatherin-law all that has been proposed on his behalf and, offering a sheep, is anointed.  ## The Marriageceremony-\"Ratet.\"  As soon as possible after this the first and most important, though not the greatest, marriage ceremony takes place. It is called \" Ratet,\" which means\" the tying.\" It occurs just after dark in the house of the bridegroom's mother (or his own house if he has one, i.e.  if already married), where relations of both parties sit talking and laughing very quietly round a small pot of beer decorated with \" Korosek \" (sacred plants) from which the guests drink through long tubes some 8 or 10 feet, long. The principal old man of the \"Kokwet\" or social unit sits on the east of the fire, and a large ox-skin is placed on the opposite side for the bride and bridegroom to sit on. Presently the bride is heard arriving, for she usually wears at her waist the virgin's bell-not always of course. She is conducted by her father and mother and perhaps also brothers and sisters. There is no space for all the details (which I have seen many times), the ceremony  ## 10~  lasting some two or three hours. Suffice it to say they first sit in a row opposite the officiating elder. Plaits ofa certain grass (segutyet) are made and anointed with butter and the bride and bridegroom, sitting side by side, each ties on the wrist of the other a bracelet of segutyet while the elder chants blessings, asking happiness, prosperity and many children for the pair. The four principals, carrying in their hands bouquets of the leaves of the Karasek of their clan, form a procession going round the beer poot under an arch of beer tubes, and then outside and round the \" mabwayta \" each four times. The mabwayta corresponds to an altar and always stands on the east side of the house (comparable with Njor the eastern side of the house, referred to above).  We see here several items reminiscent of the European marriage, viz. the officiating elder exhorting and blessing the pair, the best man, the bridesmaid, the bouquets, and finally the mutual bracelet on the other's wrist, which seems to c6rrespond to the European ring.  It is interesting to note. that the man does not only tie the girl, but each ties the other, which is surely some evidence that marriage is not the one,sided purchase that some are apt to suppose.,  ## Betrothal.  This same ceremony is used for the betrothal of a young\" uninitiated \" girl to the man who will subSequently be hel' husband after she comes forth from the initiation.  ## Suetap Toga.  The next ceremony is called Suet ap Toga, i.e. viewing the cattle.  It may be postponed even for years if the cattle cannot all be handed over at once. It ratifies the contract made at the true marriage ceremony, but must be completed before the grand ceremony and entertainment can take place.  KATUNISYET(from tun-to marry).  To this ceremony and feast come enormous numbers of relations from great distances. It is such an expensive affair that it is often postponed till after there is quite a large family of children, and in some cases is dispensed with altogether.  ## Otherceremoniesconnectedwithmarriage.  Side by side with these true marriage ceremonies are others of the nature of continued stages of initiaiiion for men only. For example, the first one after the great initiation is called \" Eito ap Muget .\u2022, It should occur soon after the great initiation period alnd before marriage, but often occurs just after the \"Ratet\" ceremony. At this ceremony it is interesting to note that young men are taught t<Y  respect married women, to respect the body of women in fact as the mother of the race. By means of an amusing practical joke (taken very seriously) they are taught to cease being ribald about the female anatomy, to cover themselves in the presence of women, and see that women are covered. They are even told not to consider it a matter for attention or comment to see a girl, large or small (not merely a woman), lying naked asleep, and so on. I mention this as it is rather different from the ideas often current amongst Europeans about the morality of a people whose customs happen to differ from their own.  There are three further stages of initiation, the last occurring in old age. The fact that only married men take part shows that they are connected with the previous marriage ceremonies.  ## Polygamy.  Polygamy is practised amongst the Kipsigis, but probably little over 10 per cent. of the men have more than one wife. Some points worth noting with regard to polygamy are the following:- (1) A man may not use the presentation cattle, \"tog-ap Koyta\" accruing on his daughter's marriage to obtain another wife (though I understand that among the Nandi a man may do so if he has no sons).  (2) Polygamy is by no means confined to old men as is often supposed by Europeans (e.g. there are only two men on my land who have more than one wife: one is 28 years old and has three, and the other is 35 years old and has two wives).  (3) Polygamy is as much appreciated by women as by men.  When a man wishes to take a second wife he usually consults, his first wife-he certainly does so if he is wise. She then frequently selects a wife from amongst her own friends. When such is the case harmony obtains, though of course one cannot say that all plural marriages are happy, any more than one can assert it of monogamy-even amongst Europeans. It is sometimes the wife herself who asks the husband to give her a .\u2022 siet \"-that is the word used to describe the relationship of one wife to another-on the ground that she requires someone to help her. The first wife amongst these people has very little superiority over the others; nor are the children of subsequent wives under any appreciable disability in the matter of inheritance. (See article on Property.) (4) From the man's'point of view there is something to be said in favour of polygamy, for, under the customs governing sexual relations amongst the Kipsigis there are a large number of occasions and periods when cohabitation is prohibited, more especially in connection with pregnancy and the post-natal period.  ## 104 Kipkondit.  The ancient custom of \" raising up seed \" to a deceased husband by his brother is also practised. It forms the only exception to the strictest exogamy. It is to be noted that a widow is under the care of a certain brother \u00b7of her deceased husband, and expects from him help in all social matters, in the field, house-building, and so on, especially if she has no grown-up sons. But as regards sexual relations with him, it is only with mutual desire that it occurs. More usually the woman finds another man, usually too poor to marry, with whom she lives exactly as though they were married, only with this difference, that the children legally belong to",

        "sentence_chunk": "the deceased husband and inherit from him.  The de *facto* husband has no relationship with the deceased husband's family.  'l'his form of union is recognised as a proper one and called \" payet-ap-ge,\" i.e. feeding one another, or rather boarding and lodging one another which describes its purpose as being for mutual help.  One has seen the word translated as \" adultery \"-a most unsuitable word for it as an approved form of union, not an illicit one, as the word adultery implies.  ## Divorce-Keil-Ge.  Divorce is recognised, but not very commonly resorted to. It .consists in the husband and wife each anointing the other and saying \" Kaynutik ap Musarek,\" the particular names of childhood which are never used when adult (except by fathers to their children).  Separation, however, is common, the presentation cattle being returned (without any mutual anointing) if there have been no children of the union or if the woman takes with her the children. If, however, she leaves any of their children with the father, then the cattle are not returned.  If such a woman from then on lives permanently with one man 3S if he were her real husband, and the original presentation cattle have been made good by the de *facto* husband, then he becomes recognised as the father of any children of the union, and they can inherit from him, and not from the first husband. If, however, the second husband did not restore the\" tog'ap Koyta,\" or again if the woman does not stay permanently with one man, when she is said to be a \" chebkesesyot \"; then any children she has belong to the original husband. Whether a man was her real husband or not becomes apparent on his death, for only if he had become her real husband does the woman carry out what is called \"Ngesire.t.\" i.e. all the .ceremonies of respect and sorrow which are too many to enumerate, but particularly conspicuous is the removal of her ornaments and the potsherd from the house roof.. This, be it noted, she can only do with the approval of the \" Kokwet.\" In fact it is the Kokwet with the  aid of one or more \"Kirnogik,\" i.e. judges or counsellors, which dOOidetf all matters of divorce or separation, and decides between disputing clans, for, being the local council it knows all the details of the csse; whilst the \" Kirnogik \u2022\u2022 not being local, are free from bias.  ## Female Marriage-Ketunci Toloch.  There is still one curious form of marriage to be referred to, viz'i the taking of a wife by an old childless widow. The native name for this explains its purpose. It is called\" Ketunchi toloch,\" i.e. \" one marries for support,\" for toloch is from tolayta, the support of the upper storey in a married person's house. This might refer to the support of the widow herself by prospective sons, or to the support of the husband's\" house\" by carrying on the family, probably the latter. The widow goes through exactly the same procedure as a man in taking to her a wife. A husband is found for this \" wife\" from amongst the relations of the deceased husband of the widow, if possible. Failing that, some other man of the girl's choice. Children of this union are the children of the widow and her deceased husband.  We see here an attempt to prevent the dying out of a famIly referred to above. This form of marriage, however, as might be expected, is not very successful, the girl sometimes resenting subordination to an old woman is often far from happy. On the other hand the desire of a childless woman to have children in her old age to support her is understandable amongst a people where old age without children is hard and lonely.  We have now before us sufficient data, when I add a few comments which I have reserved till the end, to consider what constitutes marriage and why the marriage tie has no longer the same universal respect that it formerly had.  ## The Significance Ol\" Presentation Cattle.  We may start from what I have called the presentation cattle, so usually called in the past the \" bride price,\" for it is this transaction which has caused much misunderstanding of African marriage; 1 have advisedly used the term .\u2022 presentation cattle \" because\u00b7 that is what the Kipsigis actually call them. That is they use the word for\" to give \" not the words for \" to buy \" or \" to sell.\" They say' also\" Keganda toga,\" but this word is exclusively used for this transaction, and for nothing else, so that we cannot interpret its meaning in English except by the native feeling on the subject. I say feeling, for all old custom is based on feeling, not on thought, not only amongst Africans, as is somethings assumed, but amongst Europeans as well. The feeling seems to be chiefly that it is a compensation for a life taken-somewhat similar to the\" Tog'ap Moget \" which is the compensation in the case of homicide, and note that it is only in the case of homicide by a member of another clan; it applies neither. to  foreigners nor to one's own clan. 'l'his was usually nine head of cattle, irrespective of sex or age, whilst the presentation cattle amount\u00b7 only to\u00b7 about four nead. Is this perhaps because the life is not lost altogether and the woman still has duties to her father's family? We have just seen that if a woman who leaves her husband does not take with her the cnildren she had by him, he cannot claim the return of the presentation cattle, for he has the lives of the children from the otlier clan.  If she returns to the clan leaving no children behind, her parents..  willingly return the presentation cattle, for the husband has gained nothing and has ceased to be responsible for their daughter. If she runs away to another man he is usually willing to make good the cattle and to undertake the responsibility if the woman will really stay, i.e.  if she had some good cause for leaving her first husband, a matter on which the Kokwet used to adjudicate. The difficulty arises howeverwhen she is, as they put it, a \" bad woman\" and will stay with no man permanently, as is increasingly common the last few years. Then the parents naturally are unwilling to give back the cattle, wnilst the husband continues to demand them, for it is likely he may expect ner children, even though any she bears are his in law.  ## What Actually Constitutes Marriage.  That the\" presentation of cattle\" does not, however, constitute marriage is very clearly shown as follows: A man may steal, as it is called, a bride by carrying out with her before the necessary witnesses, a curtailed form of the \u2022. Ratet \" ceremony, Le., the mutual tying of the bracelets. This is resorted to when parents or guardians will not give their consent. It is a love match corresponding to our Gretna Green and to some registry office marriages.  I have been present at such a runaway match and have subsequently watched closely the procedure followed when the young wife subsequently ran away, and would stay permanently with no one.  It is an absolutely binding marriage and no presentation cattle are given. It is true that later on, when the parent's anger has subsided or when the young man can find cattle, he will present cattle to the fun amount in the end, if he is a good man, and for this reason only, that he may have the friendship of his wife's family, and may show them respect. One's wife's family and clan are called\" Konyitenik,\" which means\" those whom we honour,\" and no man is happy who is on bad terms with these\" Konyitenik.\" The man's own family would resent his not honouring the family of the woman he had introduced into their family.  The\" Ratet \" ceremony alone constitutes legal marriage, Le. the children of the union inherit the property entailed in the father's family, and any other man who takes that woman cannot have children of his own by her without the divorce ceremony. If, how-  ever, presentation of cattle has been made, return of the cattle withoul; ritual divorce is sufficient to transfer the inheritance.  Let us consider another set of circumstances which throws light on the presentation cattle. Compare, the customs in this respect of the 811ied tribes, Kipsigis, Keyo, and Tugen (called Kamasia) which less than 200 years ago were one tribe. (Note: I know only the",

        "sentence_chunk": "Kipsigis ~ustoms by experience, those of the other members by hearsay from the Kipsigis and by asking questions when visiting the territories of the other tribes.) (1) Amongst the Kipsigis the presentation cattle are merely held in trust by the father of the bride for her brothers. This is proved by the fact that he may not dispose of them in any way, or even use them again as presentation cattle. The bride's brothers may not dispose of these cattle in any way except as presentation cattle when taking wives themselves. If not thus used, they are inherited by their children to be used as presentation cattle only. If the bride has no brothers when her mother and father die (so that there is no possibility of her having brothers) the cattle revert to the bride in trust for her .children. Now, note that these cattle, may not be used by the bride's half-brothers, i.e. her father's sons by another mother, and they do not inherit these presentation cattle, which they would do if the cattle were the property of the bride's father.  Turning to the Keyo, we find that they do not make a presentation of cattle on marriage, but when the bride has children her husband gives her cattle for her children. This is what occurs amongst the Kipsigis in the special case just cited.  Again, amongst the Tugen I gather that there is no gift of cattle .at all; marriage consists only of the \" Ratet \" ceremony, followed by the \"Katunisyet.\" There is, however, the exception of the ., Lembus \" section of the Tugen tribe who follow the custom of either the Kipsigis or the Nandi (I am not certain which) in respect of pre- sentation cattle.  All this goes to show that\" presentation cattle,\" formerly called --\" bride-price,\" is not essential to the legality of a marriage, and is not a purchase price, but that it cannot be omitted without injustice where it is the custom, or without destroying the respect and good feeling between families related by marriage, which is of the greatest service in preserving harmony and good feeling in each district. This is not merely a wordy observation, but the result of years of experIence of the practical value of the system.  To show that the presentation cattle are, besides being a compensation for a life, also a guarantee of proper treatment of the daughter, is more difficult. This fact appears to a small extent in the foregoing considerations-, but is chiefly seen in the conversations which take. place during the \u2022\u2022 proposal \" visit, Kegoyta toga, and also in ,the exhortations at the first and essential marriage ceremony, Ratet.  Not only is the suitor's father questioned as to the eligibility of his son, as regards family, generation, and ability to find presentation cattle, but also as to his character, what property he has for the support of a wife and family; or, nowadays, what capacity he has for earning sufficient to acquire property.  Both bride and bridegroom at the Ratet ceremony are exhorted to behave in such a way as to bring no discredit on the other or upon the families, e.g. by being mean, selfish or inhospitable.  Such subjects being mentioned at the same\u00b7 time as the presentation cattle seem to indicate that the cattle are more than compensation. The fact that a man has to part with four head of cattle when taking a wife must make him take the matter much more seriously and consider well before he takes the step, than if he merely took the girl and married her hastily in a moment of passion.  We come now, finally, to the following question: Why is it that there is an increasing lack of respect for *marriage,* as exhibited by the frequency with which young married women run away from their husbands, thus causing endless difficulties and trouble between families, which, more than once lately, has culminated in murder.  It is impossible to give anyone reason. Many causes have been suggested, both amongst this tribe and others, most of which only apply to particular cases. For example, those who dislike polygamy will attribute it to that institution, saying that the old men take the young girls against their wills, leaving the young men without wives, and often depriving them of their sweethearts. This probably does occur at times, but though unfortunately, I know personally of a very large number of cases of runaway wives, yet I can only call to mind two such cases. More often (I know such cases) it is an oldish man taking his first wife, who fails to keep her. As I have already mentioned, young men, as well as old, marry more than one wife. I know also a number of cases where a girl has been given her choice, and then has run away before a year is out. Even when a girl marries her own young sweetheart, as I have seen twice recently, she may run away. One can therefore lay down no rule and say that it is polygamy, or that it is because girls are forced to marry against their will. ,These are undoubtedly contributory causes. But, before the advent of the European, they were not the cause of any running away, firstly, because there was less opportunity of doing so, and, secondly, because it did not enter their heads to do so. That probably is the basic reason. Expressed otherwise, it is the result of the new freedom, which the old method of bringing up children and some of the old laws are not strong enough to control. Thus., from earliest childhood, children are allowed the greatest freedom. Though they are taught duty to parents, and respect to all elders, and are, therefore, always polite to such, yet they may go off to neig~bour's hous:s, a mile or more away, where they are sure to be fed WIthout questlOn  .and may stay the night if they like; for hospitality is general, and anyone who did not feed any visiting children would be considered mean and ill-tempered. '1'he children never need ask leave for such excursions, and the parents only enquire subsequently where they have been. Thus the habit of free wandering is learned early, and not easily given up later in life.  In the old days, when they were surrounded by enemies, this resulted in little harm, but now, since the advent of the European, there are no boundaries beyond which they cannot go. Children may go off and obtain work, which means not only food and lodging, but wages.  And so young married women find they can run away to foreign people, whether on farms or in the Kisii Na.tive Reserve, where they cannot be found. Even if found, there is no penalty, for, though they can ?e ordered to return, and brought back, they can simply run away agam.  Some have suggested that they run away because the work is 'bard, but amongstl the Kisii the woman's work is as hard as among the Kipsigis, if not harder; but they can equally run away from there and return to their parental home. Another reason why disregard of marriage is so common is that there is no fear for the future, for a family cannot refuse to receive and care for any member unless they are ceremonially outcast. This is only fe,sorted to in cases of habitual theft or witchcraft, and means that the outcast is no longer a Kipsigis and may be put to death.  Thus a woman may even run away and turn complete prostitute, and yet be sure tha.t on her return she will be received by her family and her clan.  Polygamy, then, hard work, and marrying a man not of their own choice, are contributary causes, more. especially the last, but the real causes are the freedom of early up-bringing, which, under the new conditions, teaches them that they can wander at will with impunity, and can be sure both of a present livelihood and of a. future welcome back to the family. The growing number of examples of returned prostitutes in prosperity is a further encouragement.  What remedies can one suggest for this rapidly growing evil, which may, in the end, completely undermine the life of the tribe? Hardly a week passes but a case of a runaway is brought to my notice.  Husbands, brothers, and fa\u00b7thers spend quite a considerable time travelling, hunting for these stray women. They are all quite young, usually in the first or second year of marriage.  The custom is that every girl is married as soon as she comes out of the Initiation,",

        "sentence_chunk": "though, as I have said, the marriage may not be consummated for even a year. Now, under these conditions, they obviously cannot all have free choice of a husband, for they have no one in view, and would prefer to remain single for a time in many  cases, I expect. If they did so we should doubtless have a new trouble in the form of illegitimate children, for where would these young women live? There are no houses for them. Hut tax is partly responsible for the paucity of houses; this is surely a. great argument for its replacement by poll tax, so that there may be free tlouses for women, and better houses for children and unmarried men.  Further, even with free choice of husband, the young women still run away.  Amongst Europeans public opinion demands that a man and wife keep up the appearance of living together, even though they have other lovers. Kipsigis public opinion, and the feeling of the woman herself, are directly opposed to this, and could not tolerate the. idea of living with one man whilst associating with another. Hence, when a marriage is unsatisfactory no pretence is made, and the wife simply runs away. 1'0 alter the up-bringing of the children would undoubtedly go to the root of the matter, but it will take years, generations in fact.1'he same applies to the alteration of the marriage age.  'fhere is one thing, however, which could be done in the meantime to alleviate the situation.  When a young married women runs away, in nine cases out of ten she goes to another man (if she returns to her family little harm is done). Though one cannot put any penalty on the woman, the man who takes her is equally guilty, if not more so; for he has no excuse which, in some cases, the woman has. If he were at once made responsible by being compelled to hand over the presentation cattle, he would certainly think twice about taking another man's wife, \u00b7more especially as, having run away from one man, she may do so again. Furthermore, many a man who is glad to take advantage of such young women, has not the necessary cattle, and it could be enacted that if he fails to produce the cattle he would have to go to gaol, or, better, to suffer some other form of punishment. If this deterrent were put upon the men, undoubtedly there would be less temptation for young women to run away-for they could then only return to the parental home.  Government may find such a procedure difficult perhaps (for I am not acquainted with legal matters). But help of some sort is most urgently needed, and this seems the only speedy method of alleviation.  One other comment may he added. If the presentation cattle were converted into a money payment, as I understand is being done amongst the Kikuyu, and seems to be in favour for Christian marriage, it degenerates into the purchase of a wife for cash. The money will probably be spent by the father, or others, instead of being kept for the benefit of the bride's brothers and their children, or for the bride's own children. This might be a serious matter in more ways than one, for children would be without property and so not have the means  of marrying, and also, the milk supply, so important amongst these pastoral people, especially for the children, would be further depleted when already, in many districts, it is insufficient. It seems improb- able that the money would be entailed to the children, as it the-case of livestock.  The present system of presentation cattle actually helps young men to get married, for it is to the bride's brothers that the cattle go, for their use in obtaining wivesin their turn; whereas one understands that in the case of cash payment it goes to the bride's father, thus bringing about the condition which those who disapprove of legal polygamy complain of, that the elder men have an advantage over the younger as regards marriage.  The custom of presentation cattle, on the contrary, puts a young Kipsigis man in a better position to marry than his young European confrere.",

The study of marriage systems of a tribal society not only brings to light the affinal relationships between the kin of bride and groom and thus the ideological principles of descent but, as E.M.Chilver has pointed out (pers. com.), 'provides clues to much else - such as belief systems and notions of the person.' In the following I would like to take up Chilver's point. What does the study of Yamba marriage forms tell us about their belief systems and notions of the person?  First, I shall describe the Yamba marriage systems. I shall start with exchange marriage, suppressed by the British colonial administration in 1924, and then go on to bridewealth marriage as practised by the Yamba up to the 1960s when the 'marriage shovels' used in the payment of bridewealth became obsolete and were replaced by money. Regional differences, where they exist, - especially between Lower and Upper Yamba - will be pointed out and I shall also mention some new developments which have taken place. I shall next describe some unorthodox marriage practices. From there I shall go on to explain exogamic rules and incest prohibitions, as they are extant in Yamba society. I shall further elaborate on the special relationship which exists between mother's father/brother (MF/B) and daughter's/sister's son (D/ ZS) and examine the role of the bride-giver. Finally I will have something to say on 'completed marriages', i.e. marriages which end in divorce or death.  ## 2. Yamba Marriage Systems 2.1. Marriage By Exchange (Kupse)  According to R. Fardon (1985: 79f), the Mbem (Yamba) formed part of the group of peoples extending from the Benue in Nigeria right down to the Bamileke chiefdoms in Cameroon for whom marriage by exchange was the one preferred form of marriage. Documentary evidence from early colonial administrative records supports the existence of this practice among the Yamba (Carpenter 1933: 61, also Migeod 1925: 141), although there is one curious entry in the earliest report by E.G. Hawkesworth (1923). In para. 60 he states that 'the Nsungli custom of exchanging a daughter or son for a wife is never utilised.' Hawkesworth's statement receives unexpected support and  clarification from a statement by F.W. Carpenter when he writes, 'Among the Lus of the Mfumte\u00d6marriage by exchange never took place, as members of the clan made the shovel shaped pieces of iron which were used as currency and for nothing else' (1933: 62). Up till 1933, the Yamba and Mfumte were lumped together as one people and referred to as the 'Kaka'. It was Carpenter who discovered that there were actually two peoples involved, the 'Mbem' (Yamba) and the Mfumte. So Hawkesworth must have got his information in Lus and applied it to the whole area.  Whether the whole of Mfumte did not practise the system of exchange marriage I cannot tell since I don't know the Mfumte area, but my information would support the absence of this system among the Lus people. I was puzzled by the statement of one of my informants, Sam Kobuin of Nkwi quarter of Gom. He told me that they never practised exchange marriage in Nkwi. When I asked him where Nkwi people came from, he said that his father told him that they came from Lus. The reason he gave for the rejection of this system by the people of Nkwi is interesting. He said that exchange marriage is tantamount to marrying your *male*Ngu (mother-in-law, in the extended sense) and that was not 'correct'.  Oral testimony on the practice of exchange marriage is rather confusing. I have met several people who told me that their grandmothers were married by exchange, but when asked for details they were unable to give clear information. Historically both systems, bridewealth and exchange marriages were practised. Some informants say that exchange marriages were not very common. They insist that bridewealth marriage was the normal practice.  Exchange marriage, according to them was a 'last resort', a kind of substitute which poor family heads with no means of getting bridewealth had to fall back on. One informant used the Pidgin English expression 'how-for-do' marriage to explain the derogatory nature of exchange marriage.  Informants disagree on whether the exchange of women was a 'clean' exchange or whether gifts and services accompanied the exchange. Migeod, who travelled through southern Yamba in 1924, says of the Mbem that 'two men will take each other's sisters in marriage and there was no headmoney' (1925: 141). Carpenter (1933: 61) is not clear on whether there was an exchange of gifts after the wooing when he states, 'Where there was an exchange marriage no presents were given during the wooing'. One of my informants described the former practice of marriage by exchange as follows: '(Exchange marriage) was the custom of a very long time ago when people did not know about marriage as we know it now... If I see your daughter and I like her, I will go and see you. I will say, 'Yes, this your daughter, I   like her. Come to my compound and look around. Do you like one of my daughters?' You say, 'Yes, I like this one'. Aha! I go to your compound and you come to my compound. You take some palm wine and bring to me. I take some palm wine and bring to you - till the time has come when your daughter has grown up. Then I take my wife. You will take the girl and give me. When my own daughter has grown up, I will say to you, 'Come, take my daughter!' Then you take her. We are even. I won't cook meat and give you. I need not do anything again. You too, you do not cook meat and give me. You need not do anything again. That is all.' (Monday Kongnjo of Gom, 28 June 1991).  Most informants however say that gifts and services were exchanged. Dan Taku Taabi of Ngang said that 'expenses' (the Pidgin English word for marriage gifts) were given mainly to satisfy the family members. A 'clean' exchange of women left the family members out in the cold. They were deprived of a share in the normal marriage services and gifts, which go with bridewealth marriage. Their ill-feeling and anger was translated into the idiom of witchcraft. Informants were almost unanimous in stating that exchange marriages were prone to attacks of witchcraft.  Another example of the kind of misfortune which could threaten marriage by exchange was given by Monday Kongnjo. It must be remembered that bridewealth and exchange marriages existed side by side and that there was no difference in filiation. Kongnjo's statement implies that two daughters whose mothers were married under the bridewealth system could be exchanged: 'But there was something which could bring problems into this marriage system (of exchange). If the father of the girl has not 'fixed' her mother (i.e., has not finished with his bride-giver as regards festal gifts and bridewealth, H.G.), misfortune would befall the girl. The daughter of a father who has 'fixed' her mother will deliver many children. Her children will fill the house. Your own daughter, because you did not 'fix' her mother fine will deliver children but they will all die. That's when the problem started.' (Interview, 28 June 1991).  Pa Monday addresses here the problem of the equivalence of fecundity, which was expected but in reality seldom attained. Yamba belief puts the blame for this problem on the father of the girl and his neglect of affinal obligations. In the case of bridewealth marriage the bride-giver would be trying to get all the gifts and bridewalth he is owed, even if it meant getting them out of the husband of his daughter's daughter. Anything the father of the girl did not give for her mother as regards marriage gifts and bridewealth he has to pass on to  his own father-in-law when the husband of the girl brings it to him. By exchanging his daughter in marriage this road was effectively blocked. Hence the belief that exchange marriages were wide open to attacks of witchcraft.  It is interesting to note that none of my informants connected the",

        "sentence_chunk": "disappearance of the practice of marriage by exchange with its suppression by the British. Rather they credit the demise of its practice to the frequent attacks of witchcraft. Nor did I hear any Yamba lament the passing of exchange marriage.  ## 2.2. Bridewealth Marriage (Ywin Ngwe)  Since the suppression of the practice of exchange marriage by the British in 1924, when they applied Nigerian laws in the mandated area, bridewealth marriage (ywin Ngwe, literally 'buy wife') became the main form of marriage among the Yamba. This system which includes both bridewealth and gifts and services was a protracted affair involving several stages.  Bridewealth was paid in so-called 'marriage shovels' (so). Two sizes of shovels existed. The smaller type which was manufactured by both Yamba and Mfumte blacksmiths was the former 'currency' used in the payment of bridewealth. They were replaced in the 1940s by the larger type which were made exclusively by the famous Kwaja (Mfumte) smiths.6 These marriage shovels were flat pieces of iron, the larger type being 67 cm long and 24 cm wide at the widest point and about 3 mm thick. They have a peculiar shape and have sometimes been described as two partly overlapping hoes. Their size and shape make them completely useless for any practical work such as farming. They were prestige goods (nte) and solely used for the payment of bridewealth. After the plebiscite of 1961 when the people of the former British Cameroons were asked to choose between achieving independence by joining the independent Federation of Nigeria or the independent Republic of Cameroon, the marriage shovels became obsolete and were replaced by money. The exchange rate was one shovel to one thousand francs CFA.7 The chief of Mfe, then a member of the West Cameroon House of Chiefs, is widely believed to have initiated the change. As a result, lineage heads all over Yamba (and Mfumte) were stuck with large numbers of shovels now  completely useless except as scrap iron. Walking through Yamba villages one can still see scores of these peculiarly shaped pieces of iron leaning against house walls, rusting up.  Let us now look at the different stages of bridewealth marriage. I base my description mainly on information I have been given in Gom, Nkot, and Ngang for Lower Yamba and in Mfe and Mbem for Upper Yamba. The material refers to the situation as it existed up to the early 1960s when 'fattening' the bride was discontinued and marriage shovels were replaced by money. But I will nevertheless point out some new developments that have taken place. In order not to overburden this chapter I will have to leave out minor and nonessential details.  ## 'Carrying Off' The Woman (Bu'\u00b4' Nwanwe)  If a young man sees a girl in the market or at the dancing field who takes his fancy he will try to find out who her parents are and where she lives. He will also inquire whether she is free to marry. He will report to his family that he has seen a girl he would like to marry. There will be a family meeting to find out whether there are any exogamic or incest prohibitions which could obstruct a possible marriage. If the road is clear, a 'sister' (njE'gu, a female dependent of the lineage) will be given the task of meeting the girl and presenting her with a small gift. Formerly this would have been in the form of a small quantity of boiled mesocarp of palm nuts wrapped in a leaf, called lE'. The girl will want to know the man to whom she is to be given as wife and if she agrees she will tell her parents. If the parents agree to the match, the mother will cook some food and ask the girl to bring it secretly to the lineage head of her future husband as a sign of their acceptance.  On an agreed day the young people of the lineage will seize the bride at the market or the dancing field and carry her off to the suitor's compound. At the compound there will be rejoicing and everybody joins in the *tajo'* dance.  ## 'Fattening' The Bride  The bride will stay about a week in the compound moving about freely. Then a day is set to begin the seclusion of the bride (nisi Nge'). On that day tajo' is danced seriously and the suitor has to provide ruk ncum (palm wine for the drum, i.e. the drummers). Then the bride is confined to her house. She will stay there with an attendant (njE'gu) to keep her company for about three weeks. A specialist (Nga nisi Nge') gives the bride a certain medicine called nd\u00b4m Nge'. This is a medicine in powder form which is believed to secure the  bride's love and absolute loyalty to her husband. It is also believed to enhance the fattening of the bride. The bride is not allowed to leave the house or to do any work except basket weaving if she knows how to do it. She will be given nourishing food, especially meat, and palm wine to drink. She bathes daily and is rubbed with bu' (camwood). In Mfe the seclusion was not so strict. The bride could leave the house and walk around the compound. Twice a day she would go with her attendant to the stream to bathe.   ## The Bridal Dance  After about three weeks in seclusion the bride is moved outside (Gom *fike* Nge', Mfe fe Nge'). This is the day of the bridal dance.8 The dance usually starts in the late afternoon. Many people attend the occasion. A lot of food is prepared and a great quantity of palm wine has to be provided by the family of the groom to entertain the guests. The bride's family will be present.  Plantain leaves are spread on the ground all the way from the house of seclusion to the dancing field where the *tajo'* dance is in full swing. The bride, all her body rubbed with camwood, is adorned with numerous strands of coloured beads around her waist and neck, with brass bangles on her ankles and wrists. When she leaves the house attended by a number of girls, a mat (Gom wam, Mfe ku'\u00b4) is held over her head as she walks on the plantain leaves. The Nga nisi Nge' sprays palm wine three times on the bride's chest to offset any ill effects which could attack her because of the medicine (nd\u00b4m Nge') he had given her at the beginning of her seclusion. The procession moves slowly towards the dancing field stopping frequently. There, after some initial coaxing the bride joins the dance. Her first steps are greeted with cheers and ululations and coins are pressed to her forehead. The bride does not dance with, or rather at, her husband. The groom (*ndugu*) hardly features at all on the day of the bridal dance. A brother-in-law or somebody well known for his dancing skill will be the bride's partner. They will approach each other in the centre of the dancing circle and dance at each other for some time. Then the man will put his arms lightly around the bride so that their breasts touch for a moment before they separate and return to the circle. This will be repeated a number of times. Then the bride returns to her house. The bridal dance continues into the night and starts again the following morning.  The seclusion of the bride with the preceding separation from her people, when she is carried off, and the subsequent coming out of the house of seclusion have all the hallmarks of a rite of passage. The bride emerges as a 'new' woman and is thus not allowed to put her feet on naked ground but must walk on plantain leaves. A mat is held over her head so that people may not see her. She is still shy and uncertain of her new status as a wife.   The bride's parents and family will be feasted on the occasion of the bridal dance but they play no role in any of the activities. The following morning they return to their place. The bride will stay some more days before the husband takes her back to her mother with gifts of cooked meat and palm wine.   The mat, which was carried over her head, is part of the marriage payments and is taken by her father.  ## Making Public The Marriage (**Sare Gu**)  After some time the father of the bride will tell the suitor to prepare making sare gu, i.e. to officially notify the bride's lineage of the marriage. *Sare* means to make public, to make officially known. This is also the first time when the two families meet as a body and enter into a new relationship. On the day set aside,",

        "sentence_chunk": "the suitor and some senior people of his family come with several 'jugs'9 of palm wine to the compound of the bride-giver. The bride-giver will have assembled his own family. The bride is called and asked what the occasion is all about. She will explain that it is about her marriage. Then the lineage head will ask her to remove the stopper of the 'jug' (*co' ntse' ruk*) which has been put in the middle of the room, as a sign that she has agreed to marry the man who brought the palm wine. She will then share the first cup with her husband and also give some to her father and mother to drink who thus indicate their agreement to the marriage. Then the lineage head asks the suitor, 'When you came here with the palm wine what did you hold in your hands?  Bring it!' The groom will give him three marriage shovels. These three shovels, each of which has a special name, have great symbolic meaning. None of my informants volunteered an explanation but I suggest the following: the first shovel is called *so co' ntse' ruk* (shovel remove stopper palm wine). By giving this shovel the groom pays for the bride having agreed to the marriage, i.e., for her consent. The second shovel is *so mbwin* (shovel breast). The husband acquires exclusive sexual rights over his wife. The third shovel is *so f*Ek gu (shovel cutlass marriage). The husband acquires the right in the wife's  domestic services and farm labour. In Mfe, Upper Yamba, five shovels were given, viz. two for *co' ntse' ruk*, one for *mbwin*, and two for fE*k gu*. The names of these shovels are now known only by the older generation.  Nowadays, the groom is asked to pay money instead of shovels. In Lower Yamba he pays three thousand and in Upper Yamba five thousand francs CFA. In addition the groom, in Upper Yamba, is asked to 'full-up mimbo'. After removing the stopper the bride shared out cups of palm wine - one to her husband, one each to her father and her mother, and one for herself. Now the groom is told to refill the 'jug'. He has to pay two thousand francs CFA which is equivalent to the cost of one 'jug' of palm wine.  Finally, the bride-giver tells the groom to give dakwa. *Dakwa* are rolls of groundnut paste mixed with corn flour which are sold at the market. The meaning is this: the family of the bride knows that while courting the girl - and while in seclusion - the suitor and his family must have given her presents which may or may not have been in the form of dakwa. Now they demand a share in these presents. The standard payment is five thousand francs CFA.  Before going on to the next stage, that of gifts and services, I must first digress a little and turn to one major difference which exists in the bridewealth system between Upper and Lower Yamba. In Upper Yamba the actual bridewealth - the shovels - is paid in two or more instalments. The last instalment is not paid until the wife is beyond childbearing age and her first daughter is married and has children. If the payment of bridewealth is completed earlier it is believed that the wife would bear no more children. The wife's childbearing capacity would be arrested. This suggests that contact with her natal compound is essential to her fecundity and the survival of her children (E.M. Chilver, pers. com.). In Lower Yamba, however, the husband will be asked to 'buy the wife' (ywin Ngwe) once he has finished with the gifts and services.  The reason why I discuss this here is that in Upper Yamba the groom is told to pay *mbam lak* (to lock the house) at the end of *sare gu* or soon after. Mbam lak is best explained as a first instalment on the bridewealth. It ensures the right of the husband to the wife's offspring, in other words his rights in genetricem. After this there may be no more payments as regards bridewealth until the wife is beyond childbearing age. But he has to fulfil his other obligations such as services and gifts.  Another peculiarity which concerns Upper Yamba needs mention here. To forestall the danger of mystical sanctions arising from ncim the husband has  to *lam ncim* (to 'cook' ncim). *Ncim* is difficult to translate. Some informants say it means 'oath'. L. Nsangong of Mfe explained it in this way: a woman of compound A gets married to a man of compound B. The woman is maltreated and neglected and returns to her parents. When trying to settle the palaver the two families get into a fight instead and the marriage is broken off completely. The lineage head of compound A swears publicly that never in future will a daughter of his compound marry into compound B. Such an oath could usually be traced back to an eruption of violence between two families. If now, several generations later, a young man of compound B intends to marry a girl from compound A, he will be asked to *lam ncim* in order to avert the mystical danger arising from the past violence between the two compounds. I was told that *lam ncim* is always made together with lam nf\u00b4*ssie* (to 'cook the grave', i.e., a ritual to annul the prohibition uttered by an ancestor). This suggests that ncim refers to the actual violence or fight between the two families rather than the oath. *Lam ncim* is made to counteract the effects of violence, which could threaten the spouses and their offspring while lam nf\u00b4*ssie* is performed to 'cancel' the oath of the ancestor, which could also be the cause of affliction. Formerly, if there was no memory of violence between the two families *ncim* was not demanded. Another reason for asking the groom to *lam ncim* was, I  was told, if there had been a case of known fornication between the two families.  Finally, I have to mention one more peculiarity: this concerns all marriages between Mbem, a village in Upper Yamba, and the rest of Yamba. All such marriages involve the payment of ndz\u00b4 *dze'* (goat of war). This has historical reasons. Mbem was the most belligerent village in the whole area of Yamba. Intervillage fights were usually conducted with sticks but Mbem fought with spears and cutlasses. People got killed and their heads were taken back to the village as trophies. There the warrior who had killed an enemy had to undergo a cleansing ritual (nzu'r) and was given a red feather (Ngu') to wear on his cap. But the spilling of human blood, even if it had happened a long time ago, still presents great mystical danger to all non-Mbem who want to marry a Mbem.   Such marriages are believed to be an obvious target for supernatural sanctions. So if a man from Mbem wants to marry a Mfe girl the first thing the bride-giver will ask for is the 'goat of war' which will be used to perform a ritual called dz\u00b4p fE, to cancel the supernatural sanction following the spilling of human blood (see Chapter Five).  ## 32 Chapter 2. Yamba Marriage Systems Services And Gifts  After completing sare gu the groom now starts to perform services for his inlaws. He will be asked to build a house for his mother-in-law (*ndap* Ngu), harvest palm nuts, and help in the production of palm oil, tap palm wine for his father-in-law, cut firewood, etc. In principle only 'named' services have to be performed by the groom. While working for his in-laws the groom often stays with them. As soon as the wife is pregnant the bride-giver will demand mv\u00b4p kop (mv\u00b4p means 'fowl', kop 'raffia bush' or 'palm bush'), among other fowls (see Chapter Three), and a calabash of palm wine from the groom which is used in a ritual to 'fix' the raffia or palm bush. The bride-giver will take the fowl and go to the family palm bush. There he will brush the fowl against some of the palm trees or a raffia stand. Then the fowl is killed at the palm bush shrine (mbuk kop; *mbuk* means 'stone') and some of its feathers are strewn on top or stuck in the ground around the stone.  In order to better understand the significance of this ritual we have to appreciate the importance of the kop for the Yamba. It means much more to them than just being the source of palm oil and palm wine. It is seen almost as a mystical entity with a 'personality' of its own. Before a young man of the lineage is allotted his own section of palm bush or raffia stand he is initiated (*nisi kop*) into the laws",

        "sentence_chunk": "which have to be observed. I cannot go into details about the different rituals connected with the kop; it suffices to mention one which is performed at the beginning of the tapping season (around mid-September). When a tapper has 'opened' some of his palm trees he may not drink of the new palm wine until he has first 'fixed' his *mbuk kop*. When he has collected the first palm wine he will call some young girls of the lineage (njE'gu). He gives them a calabash of the newly tapped wine. The girls gather around the *mbuk kop*. They place the fruit of a wild garden egg (Solanum sp.; Gom *ma-ja't*\u00b4, Mfe *majara*) on it and smash it. After that they each will take a mouthful of palm wine and spray it three times on the broken *ma-ja't*\u00b4 and the stone. Then they drink the rest of the wine. It is only in the evening after this ritual that the tapper will drink the first new palm wine himself.  Now, if one of these girls gets married and becomes pregnant she is no longer allowed to attend this ritual nor to enter the palm bush. Her husband has to give mv\u00b4*p kop*. If he does not do so it is believed that the palm trees or raffia bush of the bride-giver will dry up. It is obvious that we are dealing here with the question of fecundity. The young girls play a beneficial role in ensuring a plentiful harvest of palm nuts and palm wine. If one of them gets married and becomes pregnant it is as if she takes part of this fecundity away, as it were, reducing the fecundity of the lineage (for, after all, the child she bears  belongs to a different lineage). The husband has to give mv\u00b4*p kop* in order to restore or balance this lost fecundity. When he does, the happy news goes round the lineage: 'NjE'gu has given mv\u00b4*p kop.*' The bride-giver's family will be happy for two reasons. Firstly, they know that their njE'gu is pregnant, and secondly, because their kop will be fruitful.  The wife will deliver her first child in her mother's house. Ideally, after the delivery of the first child the husband has to have a ritual performed which is called *ntye muin* (spittle of child). But more often than not, this ritual is postponed till the wife has delivered several children. This ritual is performed, interestingly enough, not for the child but for its mother's mother (MM) and mother's father (MF). The father of the child has to provide a 'jug' of palm wine, a bottle of palm oil, a fowl, some salt, and nowadays five thousand francs CFA, which are given to MM and MF. These gifts are also considered part of the marriage payments.  The officiant cuts a bundle of herbs. One of the herbs, the dominant one, is called maNku'p. It is a fleshy plant with a hollow stem. He takes one of the herbs and scrapes some spittle from the child's mouth. Then he adds it to the rest of the bundle. Now he takes the maNku'p herb and breaks it over the ankles, knees, wrists, and elbows of MM and MF. After that he kills the fowl and cuts it in half. One half he puts in his bag, the other he cuts up into small pieces which he then cooks with some chopped-up herbs (different from the one in the bundle). While cooking the stew he stirs it with a calabash ladle. When the people have eaten the stew the bundle of herbs together with the ladle is fixed above the lintel of the door. I was told that if the ritual is not performed MF and MM will suffer from general weakness of the joints (from carrying around the baby, according to one informant) or they may get diarrhoea.  As an explanation I would tentatively suggest the following. Spittle is a widespread symbol of blessing and well-wishing in the Grassfields. I have once seen an elderly man holding in front of him the child of one of his relatives he had seen for the first time and spitting three times lightly on its chest.   With the birth of the first child fecundity has passed from MF and MM to the mother of the new child. Through this flow of fecundity away from MM and MF they have been weakened. The spittle of the child is meant to restore their strength. While mv\u00b4*p kop* is meant to restore the fecundity of the palm bush, ntye muin restores the strength of the mother's parents.   When the bride-giver is at last satisfied with the services performed by the groom, the latter, if he has been staying with his in-laws, will now take his   wife to his own place. But there is no strict rule, as to when the wife takes up virilocal residence. The wife may have gone to live with her husband's people soon after having made sare gu. The wife will still keep in contact with her people. As we have already mentioned, she will deliver her first child in her mother's house. She will visit her people on such occasions as funerals, births, annual dances, sickness, etc. But there are other occasions, too, when a njE'gu is called back to her natal compound. A senior njE'gu, for example, together with the lineage head will initiate a young man of the lineage when he is allotted his own section of the palm bush (*nisi kop*). The njE'gu will be the main officiant in this ritual. Together with the young man she will hold a cup of new palm wine over the mbuk kop. She will make a ritual statement saying, 'May your palm wine flow like water. Let it be white like hail-stones. Let it be sweet like sugar. May nothing spoil your palm wine.' Then she pours palm wine from the cup onto the *mbuk kop* three times. The njE'gu will also show him the herbs which he has to collect and put under the palm bush shrine at the beginning of every tapping season. Other occasions on which a senior njE'gu was called back to her natal compound concerned the cultivation of guineacorn. When the people had finished preparing the farm-plot the njE'gu came to sow the first seeds in a small patch in the centre of the farm. She returned again at the start of the guineacorn harvest. She prepared some medicine which she put in a pot full of water. She then walked around the perimeter of the farm sprinkling the medicated water. After that people started harvesting. Since guineacorn is no longer cultivated these rituals have disappeared too. But those concerning kop are still strictly observed. These rituals suggest that contact of the njE'gu with her natal compound is essential for the fertility of the farm and the palm bush and, by extension, to the fecundity and well-being of the lineage.  After undertaking the required of him services the groom is now expected to feast the bride-giver's family on several occasions. These festal gifts are called 'expenses' in Pidgin English. In Yamba each gift is called lyEm. These marriage gifts can be divided into two categories. The first concerns four annual dances - the number and type of dances may vary from place to place - and are referred to collectively as lyEm Nka' (Nka' means feast). In Gom, for example, lyEm Nka' has to be given for the four cults or dances called so', garu, *cimbi*, and Nka'Ngwu'. For each of these dances the groom has to provide food in the form of cooked meat and palm wine. The meat is cut up and tied up in leaves: so old informants always talk of 'leaf-beef'. In addition a basketful of cooked and mashed cocoyams formed into loaves is given. The standard  amount of food given in Lower Yamba is four 'leaf-beef', two 'jugs', and ten litres of palm wine.  The gifts will be carefully inspected by the lineage head of the bride's family and should they fall short of his expectations the husband has to make up the difference in money. The giving of gifts is always accompanied by much argument and conventualized criticism on the side of the bride-giver's party.   One informant told me that in one case he and his family prepared so well and had given more than enough so that the bride-givers could find no fault. Everything was correct. Finally, the bride-giver burst out, saying, 'I have come here prepared for war. Is it only one side that wins in war?' In exasperation he added that one 'jug' of palm wine was not quite full - although everybody could see that it was. The bride-receiver's party got the point and paid five hundred francs CFA to 'fill-up' the 'jug'.  Of the gifts one 'leaf-beef' with ten litre of palm wine always goes 'for",

        "sentence_chunk": "inside house', i.e., to the father and mother of the bride. The rest goes to the wider family. In Upper Yamba the procedure of giving festal gifts at dances, especially the one for the *so'* dance, is rather more elaborate and complicated and involves gifts in return so that there is a bit of give and take.  The second category of festal gifts is associated with farm work (lyEm go fak). Again there are four occasions when the bride-receiver is expected to bring gifts of food and, in addition, supply farm labour. It must be remembered that guineacorn was the main staple crop in Yamba. Thus three lyEm concerned work in the guineacorn farm and one in the cocoyam farm. The bride-giver would notify his son-in-law of the day he wanted him to come to clear the guineacorn farm. On that day the groom would come with his brothers and friends to clear the farm and also bring the gifts of food and palm wine (lyE*m gha fak*) which were more or less the same as for the dances. In return the bride-receiver's party who came to work on the farm was fed by the bride-giver's family. The second occasion was the sowing of guineacorn (lyEm Ngwi). This was followed some weeks later by weeding the farm (lyEm soso). Finally there was the planting of cocoyams (lyE*m nc*\u00b4N).  All these feasting gifts are only given once. The husband who has the support of his family and friends will get through the series quickly. Not so welloff husbands would struggle on for many years. There are cases where the husband had not finished with the gifts when his daughter was already married. In such cases, if the daughter's husband brought a festal gift to the father which the father had not yet given to his own bride-giver, he would call him and pass on the gift to him. He may not keep it. If he were to eat of it he   would expose himself or his daughter and her offspring to affliction. Although the feasting gifts for annual dances (lyEm Nka') are still given sometimes, marriage services such as building ndap gu, harvesting palm nuts, tapping palm wine, or cutting firewood, etc., are no longer performed. Neither are there any gifts of food and farm labour (lyE*m go fak*) since guineacorn is no longer cultivated. But the bride-givers are not willing to forgo these benefits altogether. In Upper Yamba, the cost of making Nwantap, *ncim*, and mv\u00b4*p kop* has increased significantly and these rituals have to be made whether or not there is any reason for making them.  Formerly, the suitor had to make N*wantap* if the bride had been engaged to someone else previously. In such a case the father of the bride had already drunk palm wine brought by the first suitor. If the engagement was broken off for one reason or another, the father could on no account drink the palm wine brought to him by a new suitor in respect of the same girl. This would expose him to supernatural sanctions. The head of the N*wantap* society must perform the rite of 'sprinkling cool water' (t\u00b4*m nz*\u00b4p) to absolve him from the agreement he had made with the former suitor. The new suitor has to provide a fowl and a calabash of palm wine needed for the ritual. On top of it he has to refund to the former suitor anything given by him to the bride-giver and the bride.  Nowadays, in Upper Yamba the groom is asked to make N*wantap* irrespective of whether the girl had previously been promised to another or not. He has to give six 'jugs' of palm wine, a fowl, and a goat. The additional payment is demanded to make up, in part, for the loss incurred by the bride-giver as regards marriage services and feasting gifts. A similar development can be noticed with *lam ncim* where costs have also risen sharply for the same reason and which is now demanded whether there was any violence between the two families in the past or not.  ## 'Buying The Wife' (Ywin Ngwe)  After having completed the bride services and feasting gifts the husband, in Lower Yamba, is now urged to 'buy' his wife. By this time the wife will already have had several children. The bride-receiver will inform the bridegiver and set a date for the transaction. The lineage head of the groom will go to his 'hiding place' and bring out the number of shovels needed which, in Gom, was thirty-three. In Upper Yamba the bridewealth was much higher. In Mfe I was told that eighty shovels were paid for a wife.10 On the set day the groom's party led by the lineage head goes to the bride-giver's compound tak-  ing along the shovels and some 'jugs' of palm wine. One 'jug' called ruk tsam ntE (palm wine - meeting - traditional riches) is taken to the house where the ceremony takes place. The shovels are carefully counted and checked by the lineage head of the bride's family. The groom's lineage head makes a ritual statement to the effect that today they have bought this woman according to the law of their ancestors. He warns any witches that if they harm her and her children N*wantap* would 'sting' them and they would die. Then he places his right foot on the shovels, takes a mouthful of palm wine and sprays it three times over the shovels. The lineage head of the bride's family does the same after having made his own ritual speech. It must be remembered that these lineage heads are also heads of the N*wantap* secret society of their respective lineages.  Since marriage shovels have gone out of use and have been replaced by money only one shovel, carefully kept in the loft of the family 'kitchen', is used. The money (or part of it) is placed on the ground and covered by the shovel. The N*wantap* leaders place their right foot on it and spray palm wine over it.  It will have become clear by now that the lineage head (bride-giver) is the one who takes charge of all marriage transactions. Whenever the suitor comes, alone or with other members of his family, in connection with the marriage and brings palm wine nobody else except the lineage head may remove the stopper of the calabash or 'jug' before they start to drink. The biological father of the bride has no more say in it than other members of the lineage. Should the lineage head go on a journey he will delegate a senior member of the family to act on his behalf. Even if the suitor comes to the house of the biological father of the bride for a social visit and brings palm wine, the latter would take it to the lineage head to forestall any suspicion. If the father removes the stopper by himself and drinks the wine it would be tantamount to challenging the authority of the lineage head.11 The presence of the members of the N*wantap* society brings the marriage under the laws of N*wantap*. One of the main laws concerns the prohibition of   adultery by the wife. From now on the wife is prohibited under pain of supernatural sanctions to have sexual relations with any man other than her husband. Adultery by the wife (fua', *nforo*) can affect herself, her husband, and her children. The channel through which misfortune passes to husband and children is the food prepared by the unfaithful wife and mother. The husband may have an accident when hunting or working in the farm, or the children may sicken and die. Divination will reveal the transgression. The wife has to confess and must disclose the name of the man with whom she had committed adultery. The adulterer has to give a fowl which is used in the rite of 'sprinkling cool water' (t\u00b4*m nz*\u00b4p) performed by the head of the N*wantap* society. After that a specialist is called in to *lam fua'* (to 'cook' the transgression of adultery - see Chapter Five).   But my information, as to the time when this law concerning the adultery of the wife takes effect, is confusing. Some informants insist that it starts from the moment that the bride removes the stopper of the 'jug' (*co' ntse' ruk*) since it is then that the marriage is made public and the groom acquires rights in uxorem. Moreover, the lineage heads of the two families concerned who are also heads of N*wantap*, are present at the ceremony. But other informants are equally insistent that the law comes into effect only when the leaders of the N*wantap* society spray palm wine over the shovels.  The marriage shovels (bridewealth) received for a",

        "sentence_chunk": "njE'gu can only be used to acquire a wife for a male dependent of the lineage. Under no circumstances may the bride-giver use them to buy a wife for himself or, if he has not completed the bridewealth payment on the mother of the njE'gu, to finish his debt to his in-laws. If he did so, my informants told me, he would be a 'man of nforo'. It would be the same 'as if he were sleeping with his own daughter (njE'gu)'. An incestuous son forfeits all bridewealth received for his 'sister' (njE'gu) and any share in festal gifts. His own wife will have to be bought with money. In other words, new shovels will have to be bought, and this may take a long time.  If the bride-giver has paid only part of the bridewealth or gifts on the mother and is now paid the full amount on her daughter, he has to pass on the amount he is still owing to his father-in-law. Should more or all of the daughters get married, his father-in-law will receive the difference for each of the daughters (and thus make a nice gain).  Here a word about filiation may be in place. As we have seen, in the bridewealth system of the Yamba the groom acquires rights *in uxorem* at the ceremony called *sare gu*. In Upper Yamba, he also acquires rights in genet-  ricem when he 'locks the house' (*mbam lak*). But at this early stage filiation is not an issue. There is an attitude of 'wait and see'. The matter only comes to a head when a daughter gets married. Since in Upper Yamba the final instalment of bridewealth is only paid when the wife is beyond childbearing age the father-in-law will watch closely what his son-in-law receives in gifts and services on his daughter. Should the son-in-law be given anything which he, his father-in-law has not been given, the son-in-law has to pass it on to him.   This applies equally to the father-in-law himself and his father-in-law of  'behind'.  In Lower Yamba the situation is clearer. When the husband buys his wife  (ywin Ngwe) he acquires rights *in genetricem* and thus all the children belong to him. But even here there are intermediate situations where not all requirements have been met. In such cases the above procedure holds good in Lower Yamba as well.  In general there is broad agreement between all the informants that children of a bridewealth marriage are always affiliated to the bride-receiver's lineage, no matter how incomplete the transactions may have been. The bride-giver will try to get his due, if not from the bride-receiver then from the husband of the bride-receiver's daughter. On the other hand, if no bride-wealth and no gifts are forthcoming the bride-giver may claim a daughter instead. As late as 1936, British administrators were still faced with this problem as the following entry in Newton's Progress Report shows: 'There is an undesirable tendency in the Mbem area for the losing parties in matrimonial causes to hand over children in satisfaction of debts incurred. Thus, when a debtor is unable or unwilling to pay in shovels he will hand over his son or daughter or niece or nephew' (1936: par. 56).  ## Tankwe  We come now to the final stage of the bridewealth marriage system of the Yamba called taNkwE (ta means father; NkwE slave). In Mfe this stage is called v\u00b4*p nten* (v\u00b4p means bone; *nten* traditional riches). TaNkwE concerns the father (F) whose daughter is already married and MMF or his positional successor (Figure 2).  To explain this stage let me start with an example of what may happen. The wife (I) fails to conceive. The husband goes to a diviner to find out the reason. Divination may reveal that the woman does not conceive because taNkwE 'cries' and wants to get his NkwE. The husband reports to F, his nts\u00b4gu (II) who in turn will go and see MMF (IV). He explains the situation and asks him  $$\\mathrm{IV}$$  ![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)  Figure 2. TaNkwE to come and take NkwE. F has to provide a goat, a fowl, a kola nut, and seven marriage shovels (in Mfe it was two). The wings and legs of the fowl are broken while the fowl is still alive and the feathers burnt off. Then the fowl is cut lengthwise into two halves. After the goat has been killed it too is cut lengthwise. Finally the kola nut is broken in two. One half of each is taken by MMF, the other by F. The breaking of the fowl's limbs is symbolic of the 'breaking' of the alliance or relationship between F and MMF. Up till the making of taNkwE mystical afflictions could affect the wife and her children (I) from the side of MMF (IV). Now this source of them has been eliminated. It also suggests that the limits of exogamic prescriptions have been reached. MMF's lineage is now outside exogamic rules in relation to the lineage of the husband (I). In Upper Yamba v\u00b4*p nt*En is nowadays combined with the payment of the final instalment of bridewealth.  Still, I was not quite satisfied that this was all to be said about taNkwE. The above ritual says nothing about a 'slave' which is clearly referred to in the term for it. Further inquiries revealed that in pre-colonial times taNkwE would claim a daughter of F (II) called moNkwE as a ward to be given away in marriage by him in order to acquire a wife for a dependent either by exchange or through bridewealth. This practice was stopped by the British because it was considered to be akin to slavery.  ## Affliction And Moral Order: Conversations In Yambaland 41 2.3. Unorthodox Marriage Forms  Now let us briefly consider some unorthodox marriage forms of the Yamba.  The first is called *ko ka* (take nothing) in Gom and zu' ntE (eat without paying) in Mfe. It is not really considered as marriage but as 'sitting down together', an unauthorised concubinage. As the name implies, no ceremonies and no gifts or services accompany this type of marriage. More often than not it concerns women who, getting on in age (or because of being handicapped) and unable to get married 'properly', would 'sit down' with a lover. All children born of this union would, of course, be affiliated to the wife's father's lineage. When a daughter of this union gets married the lineage head of the wife's family will take charge of all transactions. If the father was pleased with the man because he was respectful and helpful he may decide to leave him a son, saying, 'You have helped me. You took my daughter. You have \"born my cargo'. As there was nobody to back you up I don't want to make you cry. I cannot drive you away like a dog. So I give you this child that he may give you water, that he may help you. This is your profit' (Sam Kobuin).  I was told of another unusual type of marriage called bin by L. Nsangong of Mfe. A man without 'background' goes to live in a compound and makes himself useful there. He gets friendly with a daughter of the family and they live together. After many years when the lineage head sees that the man is unable to make a proper marriage he may decide to 'adopt' him or incorporate him into the lineage. If the man agrees the following ritual is performed. The lineage head assembles his family. He gives a cock to the wife and tells her to take it by its legs and brush it three times over the head of her husband. When she has done this she gives the cock to her husband. Holding it he makes a solemn statement saying that he has now cut all links with his family who have abandoned him and do not care for him. He will remain in this compound. After that he gives back the fowl to the lineage head. The lineage head warns all the members of his family not to discriminate against their new brother because he has taken him now as his own son.  ## Incest Prohibitions And Rules Of Exogamy  Roger Moss gave Chilver and Kaberry a version of the flood-myth he was told in Mbem12 which explains the ritual means of avoiding consequences of incest or breaches of the rules of exogamy:  The/A Creator God wandered about to test mankind, taking the form of a goat. Nobody fed it or watered it except a brother and sister. The God decided to destroy the mankind he has created and sent torrential rains which became a flood. But remembering the brother and sister who had fed and watered him in goat-form he took the form of a gecko lizard and warned them to",

        "sentence_chunk": "climb high. They were the only survivors and the ancestors of Mbem (E.M. Chilver, pers. com.).  The (unnamed) girl and her brother, Ngwa, followed the lizard and were saved. The couple travelled on until they came to Mbem where they settled. In Mbem they were given divine permission to cohabit. This myth is still reenacted in the rite called ncaN (in Mfe, nsaN in Gom), which is performed to guard a man against any evil that might befall him subsequent to marrying a close relative (Moss n.d.: 24).  Let us now examine the incest prohibitions and rules of exogamy observed by the Yamba. Incest prohibitions, called nj\u00b4br\u00b4 in Upper Yamba, extend over four generations. Nj\u00b4br\u00b4 refers to the swelling of the limbs and joints which attacks any person violating this prohibition. Marriage, if attempted, is not possible (Fig. 3). A ritual is performed to absolve the two culprits from the effects of nj\u00b4br\u00b4. After four generations marriage is still viewed as a 'borderline' case. If marriage is attempted, it is possible but the ritual ncaN has to be performed so that the couple may not suffer from any possible afflictions. In Lower Yamba only one term - nsaN - is used: this includes both nj\u00b4br\u00b4 and ncaN.  ![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)  I shall now consider the ncaN ritual which has already been briefly described by Moss (n.d.: 24). It is called dz\u00b4p ncaN (nsaN). Dz\u00b4p means 'to pound', 'to mash'. It is therefore quite different from *lam ncim*, for example, where lam means 'to cook', 'to boil'. We are dealing here with the symbolism of 'hot' and 'cold'. The breach of incest prohibitions or exogamic rules makes the people concerned 'hot'. The ritual ncaN is meant to 'cool' the 'heat' of this transgression.  If a married couple and their children are plagued with sickness and divination reveals that their troubles are due to the fact that their relationship to one another is too close, a specialist is called in to dz\u00b4*p nca*N. He cuts a bundle of special herbs and comes to the house of the couple. There he places a mat on the ground. Husband and wife are told to sleep on the mat side by side facing each other. The man crosses one leg over the legs of the woman. Then they are covered with another mat and the officiant tells the man to simulate intercourse. At this all bystanders rush forward and, each holding a thin long stick, beat the couple singing, 'O ncaN, O ncaN*, O nca*N!' After that the couple is released and they get up. A black goat is brought which the officiant kills by thrusting a sharpened piece of bamboo into its heart. He then takes the bundle of herbs and pounds them into pulp. He adds salt, palm oil, and some drops of the blood of a fowl which is also killed. The husband is now told to hold out his hands crossing them at the wrists. The officiant puts a pinch of pulp on each hand and the wife takes it and eats. Then the wife holds out her hands and the husband eats from her hands. After that each of the people present are given a small quantity to eat. Now the officiant stands up and holding in his hand the small round stone with which he pounded the leaves he makes a ritual statement saying that he has come to dz\u00b4*p nca*N for this man and his wife.   Should somebody dare to spoil it with witchcraft that person will die. Saying this he knocks the stone several times on the ground. Then he touches the forehead of husband and wife with the stone. This done he clambers up to the roof-top of the man's house. He first pins a stick into the thatch right on top, puts some of the pulp-medicine there, and sprays a mouthful of palm wine over it. Finally, he takes a broken earthenware pot and covers the pinnacle of the roof with it. The fact that everybody present (of the lineage) eats of the  'medicine' shows that, according to Yamba belief, the effects of the transgression can attack any member of the lineage if it is not 'fixed'.  An incestuous relationship within the minimal lineage is also called nj\u00b4br\u00b4.   Sexual relations between a man and his full-brother's wife is considered an especially heinous crime. One informant said that in such a case the adulterous wife would have to be sent away. This is a transgression which cannot be   'fixed'. The same applies to sexual relations between a father and his son's wife. It is firmly believed that the incestuous father would be struck dead. If a son were to sleep with one of his father's wives that would be a very evil thing too, but this transgression could be 'fixed'. 13 Here follow some other examples recounted to me: - When a man dies the widow can choose the man she wants to be her husband among the male members of the lineage. But once this man has had intercourse with her no other man of the lineage may marry her again should he later decide that he does not want her.  - If a man has had intercourse with the wife of his 'brother' (classificatory) he may not inherit her should the brother die.  - If a man of lineage A marries a woman of lineage B, no other man of lineage A may again marry a woman of lineage B. But a woman of lineage A may still marry into lineage B.  - If a suitor intends to marry a girl, and then the girl dies, he may only marry another girl from the same lineage if he has never had intercourse with the girl who died.  Two or more lineages (*boat*E') of a quarter may be exogamous. In Nkwak quarter of Mfe, for example, the two lineages Builak and Fungung do not intermarry. If a man from Builak attempts to marry a girl from Fungung - or vice versa - it would be nj\u00b4br\u00b4. Marriage is not possible (Fig. 4, A). The marriage between a Fungung man and the daughter of a woman from Builak (married outside her lineage, of course) is possible but still considered dangerous. The rite ncaN has to be performed to protect the marriage (Fig. 4, B).  The marriage between the daughter's daughter of a woman from Builak and a man from Fungung is free from danger (Fig. 4, C).  ## Mother'S Father/Brother - Daughter'S/Sister'S Son Relationship  The mother's father/brother (MF/B) is called tE\u0178'ts\u00b4 in Yamba. This term is inclusive. It extends to all male members of the mother's father's lineage. Most often it refers to the lineage head (bride-giver) or his positional successor. A   Figure 4. Exogamic rules  ![22_image_0.png](22_image_0.png)  daughter's or sister's son is called *monj*E'. A daughter of the lineage ('sister') is called njE'gu. When she marries all her sons are referred to as *monj*E' by her father's lineage.  When asked about the relationship between MF/B and D/ZS people like to tell rather exaggerated stories about what a 'wicked' *monj*E' could do in his tE\u0178'ts\u00b4's compound, things which in reality never quite happen. One informant told me that a *monj*E' could even take the goat which his tE\u0178'ts\u00b4 has tied up and was about to kill for a ritual. The MF/B could not prevent him from taking it. He could only beg him to leave him the goat since he needed it for the ritual. If he were to seize it from his *monj*E' by force misfortune would befall his compound. The palms they tapped for palm wine would not 'leak'. They would get only little oil from the palm nuts when producing palm oil. If they reared domestic animals they would not multiply, and so on.  The privileged position of a *monj*E' in his tE\u0178'ts\u00b4's compound is due to the beneficial influence he is believed to exert on the mother's kin. But there is also the fear that if they slight him he can be the bringer of misfortune. As my   informant Sam Kobuin told me, 'They fear you like a chief although you may be a small child.' Let us examine the relationship between MF/B and D/ZS more closely. A monjE' is expected to support his MF/B with palm wine whenever he has some 'business' - 'business' in Pidgin English includes many things such as rituals, dances, death celebrations, marriage transactions, family meetings, etc.). Also, any big game a *monj*E' kills must be presented to his tE\u0178'ts\u00b4 (for details see Chapter Three). If he keeps it to himself his MF/B would 'lock' his hunting efforts. He would be unable to kill another animal. Either he would shoot and miss or he would go hunting and fail to find game.  In Mfe and other villages of",

        "sentence_chunk": "Upper Yamba, when there is a death in the MF/ B's family the lineage head will call a *monj*E' to come and perform the closing ritual called kuru bum (*kuru* means to sweep, bum tradition, 'country fashion'). This ritual takes place the day after the death celebration which follows the burial. When the *monj*E' comes he makes a bow (hom) and three arrows (NgiN). Tearing open an old carrying bag and tying it to a makeshift frame he makes a sort of war shield (d\u00b4k). The *monj*E' takes the shield with bow and arrows and goes westwards (the side of the dead). Some members of the family follow him. One carries some embers to make a fire, another takes a few twigs of a strongly scented shrub (sEn), and a third holds a small quantity of resin (liN). After having gone about fifty yards the *monj*E' suddenly stops and shouts, 'CaN! *Dze' s*\u00b4 v\u00b4!' (Run! 'War' is coming!). He turns to run but the people behind him push him forward saying, 'Don't run! Shoot! Shoot!' Then the *monj*E' shoots off an arrow. This happens three times. The third time he breaks the bow while drawing the string to shoot the arrow. He now breaks the bow completely and cuts it into pieces. He makes a fire in which he burns the resin and the scented leaves. After having returned to the compound the monjE' takes a broom and, *pars pro toto*, sweeps a small part of the yard which is littered with dirt from the celebration of the previous day. This done, he takes a razor-blade and shaves the heads of all the members of the mourning family. L. Nsangong, my informant, told me that this rite may only be performed by a *monj*E' of the compound. It is done 'to drive away death'. Death, which is evil and dangerous like war, has disrupted the life of the family. It must be driven away. The shooting of the three arrows accomplishes this. The pollution caused by death envelops the compound like dirt covering the yard.  The compound must be cleansed from this pollution. This is done in a symbolic way by sweeping the yard. The foul stench of death (corpses were formerly tied to a bamboo structure called nt\u00b4N in a corner of the yard where they were kept, sometimes for two or more days) must be counteracted by the  sweet fragrance of the burning resin (incense) and the scented leaves. A monjE' of the compound is believed to have the mystical power to do this.  Let me still give another example to illustrate the beneficial role a *monj*E' plays in his tE\u0178'ts\u00b4's compound. If members of a minimal lineage are at loggerheads with each other or have fallen out with the lineage head the latter may call on a *monj*E' to come and 'fix' his *dzok si* (hunting shrine) before the hunting season. If the lineage head were to do it the hunting ritual would be ineffective because of the strife in the family. The *monj*E' acts as officiant at the *dzok si* and performs the rite of 'sharpening the spear', (*kwi ko*N, z\u00b4 koN). According to L. Nsangong, the lineage head could also call on a njE'gu to perform the hunting ritual.  But the relationship between MF/B and D/ZS is not just one-sided. The MF/B has a protective role towards his D/ZS. For example, he protects his monjE' against unfair treatment or hostility which he may suffer from the side of his agnates. In former times this was especially the case when the monjE' was challenged to submit to the poison ordeal (Ngu) because of witchcraft accusations. Accusations of witchcraft, especially of the cannibalistic type (ru'm), are invariably directed against agnates and co-residents of the minimal lineage. The death of small children is often believed to be the work of such witches and one or other member of the lineage is accused of having  'eaten' the child. In such a case, a *monj*E' , if accused, could count on the support and protection of his tE\u0178'ts\u00b4. His mother's kin would come and accompany their *monj*E' to the place of the ordeal. (In Gom, the place to go was Nkwi). As soon as the *monj*E' has drunk of the poison he would be surrounded by his MF/B's people and, running all the way, they would take him back to his house. The fear was that he would be harmed by hostile members of his family if he were not protected by his MF/B's people (see Chapter Eight).  There are other occasions when a *monj*E' could appeal to his tE\u0178'ts\u00b4 for help.   If, for instance, he is accused of a serious theft and he denies the charge, both accuser and accused are challenged to 'lick medicine' (b\u00b4N nc\u00b4p). The lineage heads of the two litigants and their respective tE\u0178'ts\u00b4 would each bring their medicine bags (*bam bum cur*). These were knocked against the feet, knees, and chest of both men before they licked the 'medicine'. The one who lied either by accusing the other wrongly or by swearing his innocence falsely would sooner or later fall ill and unless he confessed he would die. A *monj*E' would feel more secure and better protected by the medicine bag of his tE\u0178'ts\u00b4 than by that of his own family.  When a *monj*E' dies the family will send his spear and bag to his MF/B to inform him of his death. The family is not allowed to bury him unless his tE\u0178'ts\u00b4 is present. In former days, the tE\u0178'ts\u00b4 carried out an autopsy on his monjE'. Should he find no sign of witch substance in the intestines of his monjE' the conclusion was that he was killed by the witchcraft of his own agnates. Fighting would break out and the family would be forced to pay compensation. The tE\u0178'ts\u00b4 would refuse to bury his *monj*E' until the family paid it (see Chapter Nine).  These examples show clearly that there is an almost mystical interdependence between MF/B and D/ZS. On the one hand we see the MF/B as protector of his D/ZS. But if a *monj*E' is negligent in his duties towards his tE\u0178'ts\u00b4 he exposes himself to supernatural sanctions. On the other hand we also see the D/ZS in an ambiguous role, enhancing the well-being of his MF/B's kin as well as being an agent of misfortune if he is slighted.  ## The Role Of The Bride-Giver  After having described the special relationship which exists between MF/B and D/ZS we can now go on to examine in more detail the role of the bridegiver. It has already become clear that he is an ambiguous figure, both a protector and the indirect agent of supernatural sanctions.  The bride-giver is believed to be able to influence the fecundity of the spouses in a positive way. As an example we can take the ritual called *tand*\u00b4 in Gom and *tindu*'k in Mfe. Let's suppose a husband and his wife are constantly quarrelling. On top of it all, the wife fails to conceive. She reports to her lineage head (bride-giver) who then summons the two to come and see him. The husband will bring a fowl and palm wine. After listening to both sides of the story the bride-giver will try to reconcile them. Neither husband nor wife may eat or drink during this visit to the bride-giver's compound. When they go they may not take anything along. After having settled the palaver the lineage head tells the wife to take her basket and go, impressing on her that she is not to look back till she is out of sight. When she is about to go he takes a pebble and aims it at the small of her back. By hitting her with the pebble it is believed that the eggs of the woman 'locked' in her back by the constant bickering and quarrels with her husband are now released and that she will conceive.  My informant Sam Kobuin told me of another reason for making *tand*\u00b4. If a njE'gu, when she is still young, had shown disregard of her family head and caused him to get angry by disobeying him, his anger may 'lock' her womb  when she gets married. Divination will reveal the reason for her sterility and she will be advised to go and 'beg' the family head. He will then publicly 'confess' why he had been angry with his njE'gu. But now since she had come to 'beg' him he has relented and he wants her to have many children. When she leaves he will aim and throw a pebble at her lower back and she must not look back till she is out of sight. The prohibition on not looking back and not taking anything with her suggests that she must cut herself off from her past wayward life in her natal compound leaving behind all her mistakes.   Now",

        "sentence_chunk": "she can start again, with a clean sheet and she will conceive.  It happens quite often, too, that the husband takes refuge with his in-laws if one or more children die while he is resident with his own people and if divination reveals that the death is due to the witchcraft of his agnates. It is believed that the bride-giver can protect the spouses and their children from the witchcraft of the husband's family. (See Chapter Eight for more on this).  On the other hand the bride-giver can be the bringer of affliction which can affect the fecundity of the spouses and the well-being of their offspring. As we have already mentioned, the bride-giver, his failure to fulfil affinal obligations towards his own father-in-law can be indirectly responsible for the sickness or death of his daughter's children. For example, if he were to accept festal gifts brought to him by his son-in-law which he himself has not given to his own father-in-law, the latter's anger would affect his married daughter or her children. On the same principle, the bride-giver should receive no more by way of bridewealth and gifts for her than he gave for her mother. If disregarded, this principle of the equivalence of bridewealth and gifts on mother and daughter can be the cause of affliction.  The mother-in-law too can be the cause of affliction. If she feels slighted or is angered by her son-in-law her anger can cause her daughter to have a miscarriage or else one of the children may sicken and die. In one case I was told of a mother-in-law who was so angered that she publicly swore not to eat any of the gifts brought by her son-in-law to the compound. Later on she forgot about her oath and did eat. Because of her 'mistake' her daughter miscarried and divination 'caught' the mother-in-law as the cause.14 E.M. Chilver calls   such afflictions caused by an angry mother-in-law (among other causes) 'domestic witchcraft' (1989: 11), in translating the Bali 'witchcraft of the house'.  In this connection one could ask the question: is this now seen as 'positive' or 'negative' witchcraft, i.e., sending a curse or withholding protection?15 From what I know, so far, about witchcraft beliefs among the Yamba this case of the angry mother-in-law would seem to be one of 'negative' witchcraft. By making her anger public she had opened the way for witches to act. In this respect Yamba witchcraft beliefs seem to be similar to those of the Mfumte. V. Baeke recorded one of her informants as saying, 'la parole de ta bouche me d\u00e9signe aux sorciers' (1984: 158). The angry mother-in-law is withholding her protection which gives the witches an opportunity to act. This holds good for the angry bride-giver too.   But this ambiguous role of being both the bringer of mystical sanctions and the source of fecundity and well-being of the spouses and their offspring does not stop at the bride-giver. It extends to the father-in-law of 'behind' and to taNkwE. This is best explained by a very interesting ritual called maN*ko muin* (catch children) in Upper Yamba and *mbir*\u00b4' in Lower Yamba: it takes place before the burial of a great-grandmother or -grandfather (MMM or MMF). The ritual is carried out if these great-grandparents had many children and their children had many children, and so on.  After the death of a great-grandparent the corpse is tied upright to a bamboo structure (nt\u00b4N) in a shady corner of the compound. This was the normal practice everywhere in Yamba when an adult died. When the granddaughters and their husbands have arrived a specialist is called in. He will first stick a white feather in the granddaughters' hair and a red feather (Ngu') in their husbands' hair. (Interestingly the grandsons play no role in this ritual at all). Then they will go to the nearest hill towards the east (the side of the living). Circling the hill they climb to the top. There the officiant will beat a drum and tell the granddaughters, their husbands and children to spread out and catch all the small insects they encounter and bring them back. The insects (mbEn) are collected in a small basket which has a lid to prevent them from escaping. This is done three times before they return to the compound. When they arrive they begin to sing and dance. The song they sing is the same as that which hunters sing when they have killed a leopard (nzu'r). The basket with the insects is opened and hung on the bamboo structure to which the corpse is strapped.  The symbolism of this ritual seems to suggest several things. First of all, the ritual is meant to prevent the great-grandparent from taking fecundity with him/her to the grave. To do this his/her strong power translated into the idiom of the leopard had to be overcome and killed. This is suggested by the red feather (Ngu'), with which a hunter who has killed a leopard is decorated, and the song of the leopard. The living members of the family (going to the east, the side of the living) will now continue to have many children. They will be as many as the insects on the hill. Here we also see how the flow of fecundity emanates from as far back as MMM and MMF.  ## Divorce (**Ga'A Gu**)  After having lived and worked among the Yamba for more than fourteen years my impression is that marriage stability is remarkably high. I do not intend to enter here into a discussion about divorce. I shall limit myself to what happens after a divorce has taken place.  If a woman leaves her husband and goes to live with another man and there is no hope of reconciling the two parties, the former husband would usually wait for a while before taking action. Then he would go to his former fatherin-law to ask for all the 'cargo' he has paid for his runaway wife. The fatherin-law will tell his new son-in-law to 'make N*wantap*'. In Lower Yamba this means that he would have to pay the bridewealth, including all gifts and services, to the extent the former husband has done. The father-in-law would expose himself to mystical sanctions were he to drink wine or accept any gifts from the new suitor. Thus the new husband is pressured from two sides: from the former husband who wants to have his 'cargo' refunded and from the father-in-law who wants to benefit from the new alliance. That's why Pa Monday Kongnjo called such a marriage a 'hurry-up marriage'.  On the day when the new husband comes to 'make N*wantap*' he has to refund everything the former husband has given including gifts of food and palm wine. All the children of the divorced wife will be claimed by the former husband. But in doing so the latter will not take everything he is owed. Part of the gifts and part of the bridewealth he will hand over to his former father-inlaw; the amount of the 'cargo' to be paid back to the latter will depend on the number of children which issued from the divorced wife's former marriage.  Even if the first husband had only made *sare gu* and had given nothing afterwards, I was told that he would still claim the children. He would then only receive what he had spent up to and including that stage. A divorce is final. The bride-giver could not claim anything from the marriage of his daughters' daughter by her first husband. If the husband is the cause of divorce by driv-  ing his wife away he forfeits any claim on gifts and bridewealth. But he still keeps the children.  ## Widow Inheritance (Gaps\u00b4 Nwanwe Nf\u00b4)  Marriage in Yamba as elsewhere in Africa is not a matter between two individuals but between two families. This is why one can often hear a man referring to his brother's wife as 'my wife'. At the death of the husband the widow can choose the man she wants to be her husband among the male members of the lineage. After the burial, on the day when the *lam rom* ritual (see Chapter Nine) is performed, all the men sit down in a circle. The lineage head will give the widow a cup and fill it with palm wine. The widow walks along the sitting men. When she reaches the man she has chosen she will stop and offer him the cup of palm wine. If he accepts she will be his wife. As my informants told me, the widow will have met with the man and secured his consent before she is asked to publicly choose her new husband.",

        "sentence_chunk": "It goes without saying that the family of the late husband has to continue with the marriage payments which are still outstanding.  When a woman dies before she has delivered a child the bride-giver has to refund whatever the husband has paid so far for the bride. But if she leaves a child behind nothing is paid back. Pa Monday Kongnjo gave the following reason: 'If it is a girl the father will get the \"dowry\" back when the girl gets married. If it is a boy he will live to \"control\" the compound'.  ## Conclusion.  In this chapter I have presented the marriage systems of the Yamba. I have concentrated mainly on bridewealth marriage since other marriage forms have either been outlawed or are not really considered as marriage. Returning to our original question as to what the study of Yamba marriage forms tell us about their belief systems and notions of the person several things have become clear. Bridewealth marriage establishes an alliance, a network of relationship between the two families which on the wife's side goes back to her MF and MMF. There exists almost a mystical interdependence which is most evident in the special relationship between MF/B and D/ZS. We have seen the protective role the MF/B plays in relation to his D/ZS especially when the latter feels threatened by his own family. On the other hand a D/ZS is believed to have a beneficial influence on the well-being of his MF/B's kin. It has also become clear that the bride-giver is an ambiguous figure. He has a protective role over the bride and her offspring but he can also be the indirect agent of supernatural sanctions which can affect the fecundity and well-being of the  spouses and their children. The anger of the bride-giver because of the failure of the bride-receiver to meet affinal obligations, and the anger of the father-inlaw of 'behind' because the bride-giver himself has failed to meet such obligations can be the cause of afflictions which are always visited on the last link in the chain of relationships - the wife and her children.  Social harmony and good neighbourliness between the two allied families are beneficial to the spouses' well-being and that of their offspring. Conversely, any past or present violence, enmity, or strife are detrimental and must be counteracted by appropriate rituals. Disregard of a prohibition or an oath uttered by an ancestor is likewise a threat to husband, wife, and children. Even the dead are not to be counted out.  Contact of the wife with her natal compound is essential to her fecundity.   This became most evident in Upper Yamba where premature completion of the bridewealth payment is believed to arrest the child-bearing capacity of the wife. But the flow of fecundity is not just one way. The example of the 'big sister' returning to her natal compound on ritual occasions suggests a departing and returning flow of fecundity. Yamba spouses and their offspring are in a precarious position. They are situated in the centre of a whole network of relationships which can be the source of protection and affliction, of blessing and cursing.",

Marriage is understood to be one of the most vital mechanisms in maintaining the consistency of all societies on earth.   Scholars, such as John Mbiti, understand marriage to be a drama in which everyone becomes an actor or actress and not just a spectator. While this sounds truly ideal, the reality is that most Africans understand marriage to be an institution primarily knotted within African cultural norms and traditions with disparity roles between the couple. The article argues that such an imbalance unleashes toxic masculinity and manhood ideologies which are chiefly designed to deny women the rights to be fully actresses in the theatre of marriage. It also argues for the need of liberative frameworks within which to challenge the dominative traditional and cultural dogmas which are creating disparities between men and women in marriage. Musimbi Kanyoro's cultural hermeneutics model is employed to suggest a way forward to create an equal partnership between men and women in marriage.   Keywords: culture and tradition; cultural hermeneutics; indigenous people of Africa; marriage; masculinity; manhood  ## Introduction  The institution of marriage is as old as humanity itself and exists globally with several cultural diversities. While marriage exists globally, its meaning and significance are understood within people's cultural affiliations and these differ from one culture to another. However, at the heart of this, every society accepts marriage as a vital force in maintaining and sustaining that society. It is also a means through which humans are Studia Historiae Ecclesiasticae https://doi.org/10.25159/2412-4265/10113  ![0_image_0.png](0_image_0.png)  https://unisapressjournals.co.za/index.php/SHE/index ISSN 2412-4265 (Online), ISSN 1017-0499 (Print) Volume 48 | Number 1 | 2022 \\#10113 | 12 pages \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022 Published by the Church History Society of Southern Africa and Unisa Press.

In this regard, the cultural value systems entail a totality of traits which includes everything that makes them distinct from any other group of people for instance, their greeting habits, dressing, social norms and taboos, food, songs and dance patterns, rites of passages from birth, through marriage to death, traditional occupations, religious as well as philosophical beliefs. (Aziza 2001, 31) These cultural value systems play an important role when two families come together for negotiating and legalising a marriage. While these cultural value systems are viewed as valuable to the process of establishing a family through marriage, there are, however, certain aspects of them that are toxic to the health of a marriage. Some of these aspects include: the domestication of women in marriage in the name of culture; the malefemale hierarchical domination; and the patriarchy that goes with masculinity and manhood ideologies. Such toxic aspects of marriage are linked to masculinity and manhood ideologies which are promulgated behind the facade of African cultural norms. The display of such ideologies is always seen in terms of the authority that men impose over women in marriage and how that becomes justified as part of the African cultural norms. The problem with toxic masculinity is that it benefits men while disadvantaging women. In terms of this problem, men become authoritarian voices to which women must listen and obey in marriage.   In light of this, how does Mbiti's (1969, 133) definition of marriage as \"a drama in which everyone in marriage becomes an actor or actress and not just a spectator\", become fulfilled and provide a space where both men and women can create a harmonious play in the theatre of marriage? Where sociological constructs of roles in marriage exist, freedom and rights become engulfed by those socio-constructs which do not permit freedom to exist.  While I acknowledge the intersection between marriage and African cultural value systems, it is vital to look at the balance of what Mbiti proposes as the ideal form of marriage and the realities of marriage itself on the ground. Though Mbiti's definition sounds excellent and ideal for the kind of marriage many hope to see, the balance between this definition and the understanding of African cultural norms has to be seen on the table. While I acknowledge that, in theory, marriage should allow individuals some freedom in their marital union, the idea of participating as \"an actor or actress and not just a spectator\" is far-fetched when reading this in a context of masculinity and manhood ideologies. To be fully active in the theatre of marriage where African cultural norms are employed as guiding tools for the marriage on stage, the players should be aware of the possibilities of masculinity and manhood ideologies interfering.  ## Masculinity And Manhood  The discussion on masculinity and manhood remains necessary and relevant in South Africa, particularly in communities where women are persistently facing patriarchal challenges in their marriages in the name of culture. The problems of domestic and gender-based violence, the mentality of men \"owning\" women in marriage, and the belief that the bride price gives men more authority over women in South Africa are linked to masculinity and manhood ideologies. \"Domestic violence is a consequence of men's desire to exercise power and control over their female partners, a behaviour that has been legitimised and justified within the patriarchal system\" (Mshweshwe 2020, 2). This justification is also pinned as part of African cultural norms in which men exercise power and control over women. This power goes beyond the control of domestication, to the point of controlling the reproductive process. This does not sound like two equal characters playing their parts in marriage. If a man defines a woman from a male point of view and views her roles as producing cooked meals and clothes for him, it borders on the lines of toxic masculinity.   Masculinity and manhood ideologies exist in almost all institutions where men are found. These ideologies seek to empower men and make them feel a sense of pride while exercising hegemonic authority over others (women in particular). Masculinity has been defined as a \"set of values that serves to organize society in gender unequal ways \u2026 unequal access to power, as well as the interplay between men's identity, ideals, and power\" (Mshweshwe 2020, 2).   In masculinity, one sees the idea of manliness and that of the household or hierarchical code instilled to boys while training them to be tough. Allen (in Mhlahlo 2009, 85)  defines manhood as \"the state of being a man rather than a woman or child\". It is also understood as \"a social status that is difficult to attain yet easily lost and requires continual public demonstrations\" (Vandello and Bosson 2013, 101). This is understood as one status that takes time to acquire through training for boosting men's ego, that is, proving that they are men enough. This is confirmed by Vandello and Bosson (2013, 102) in their observation that, by adulthood, men are expected to demonstrate their \"real man\" status by eschewing femininity from their behavioral, linguistic, and emotional repertoires whereas no comparable \"antimasculinity\" mandate dictates women's experiences.  This attitude grows deeper and develops into a culture from which men graduate to take control of society and all its institutions. This culture, of course, starts from the",

        "sentence_chunk": "family and/or marriage, then extends beyond to society at large. It becomes part of the characteristics that many societies use as part of their cultural identities and norms. In many African societies, boys undergo initiation stages where education about manhood is imparted by elderly men, some of whom are regarded as custodians of culture in society. Both masculinity and manhood are accepted by most African men as part of cultural values which men should have. Therefore, a man who shows his emotions is usually regarded as weak and not part of the larger group of real African men. This adds to the idea that toughness is equated with maleness while emotions and align with femaleness. This becomes a way of seeing aggression in a sense of masculinity traits where other people, particularly women, no longer feel safe (Harrington 2021).   Barker and Ricardo (2005, 5) give a different angle of what makes an ideal Africa man, apart from the training he receives from the initiation schools, and they point out that: The chief mandate or social requirement for achieving manhood in Africa - for being a man - is achieving some level of financial independence, employment or income, and subsequently starting a family. In much of Africa - where bride-price is commonplace - marriage and family formation are thus directly tied to having income and/or property.  Indeed, in a context where a man does not have an income to support his family, his masculinity and manhood are threatened not only in his home but also among his peers in society. Barker and Ricardo (2005) show that masculinity and manhood are injected by many factors that make a man feel strong and in control. In these sociological constructs of masculinity and manhood ideologies, there exists a culture infused into African believers that it is right for men to be aggressive. These are ideologies which have influenced and shaped society for centuries and are still in existence. To understand the modus operandi of masculinity and manhood within African societies, it is important to understand how African culture is made to connect with everything that is regarded as a norm. Some of the interconnectedness becomes a method within which patriarchy manifests behind African cultural norms. This is also encouraged by the fact that an ideal man has to be physically strong and aggressive as opposed to weak and emotional. An ideal man is one who protects and defends the integrity of his family and peers. He should be known for defending them strongly and sticking to his opinions no matter what; taking part in masculine activities such as sports and social drinking; being sexually virulent; and being successful in everything that he attempts. This form of masculinity embraces notions of manhood that emphasise dominant men who view violence and aggression as legitimate ways of expressing themselves, asserting their power, and resolving conflict.  While masculinity and manhood are notions with different meanings, the two are intertwined and the results of manhood translate into masculinity in many ways and deal with what it means to be a man. In most cases, masculinity does not only dominate femininity, but is seen as the major cause of gender-based violence in society.   Masculinity as an unnatural occurrence is socially constructed as opposed to being biological inherent. Boys are introduced to masculinity as part of the qualities or characteristics males should possess from their early developmental stages. Many African men receive mentoring from places - such as initiation schools during their circumcision rite - where only men gather for conversation about men's issues.   For many African societies, the role of the initiation schools, other than circumcision, is to teach, among others, \"fearlessness and aggressiveness as qualities of manhood\" (Siweya, Sodi and Douglas 2018, 1567). This is a ritual which begins at the early stage of puberty through to the traditional circumcision rite when they travel into the  \"mountain\" as opposed to the western medical circumcision procedure performed on babies. The physical pain that the boys must go through, is understood to symbolise warriorhood, which has to play itself out in society after the initiation process. The central point here is the emphasis that the initiate should \"be hard like an 'ant heap', so that he does not become a coward in future\" (Mhlahlo 2009, 72). For Maluleke (2018, 38), \"the idea that a man must pass difficult and dangerous challenges in order to prove his manhood is at the heart of this problem\". While traditional circumcision is an acceptable rite in many African societies, part of its ideology injects men with a character that they believe elevates them above women. As Maluleke (2018, 38) puts it, \"Circumcision school is but one context in which compulsive masculinity plays out\".   In other words, it becomes a point where men transcend to the idea of men they have always wanted, or that some had wanted them to be.  From all of these issues of masculinity and manhood, a clear picture is formed that describes why many African indigenous marriages experience an oppressive culture. While some men understand the need for partnership in marriage, where everything is done together in a complementary way, many others are still trapped in the masculinity ideology where a man decides and a woman acts on his decisions. The understanding of marriage as being connected to culture, is the reason why \"a woman's position in her matrimonial home is often times determined by her ability to procreate\" (Emelone 2020, 43) and \"obey\" the oppressive structure. There is a recursive of certain expectations within the institution of marriage which are argued to be cultural and traditional, yet that which is argued to be cultural is purely an endorsement of masculinity and manhood ideologies. The marital roles accorded men and women are based on the different expectations which societal groups have of individuals based on their biological makeup and on each society's values and beliefs about gender.   ## Marriage As An Equal Partnership Between A Man And A Woman  Marriage remains a fundamental necessity in the sustainability of life in the world.   Marriage, as defined by Hastings (1973, 27) is \"the union \u2026 of a man and a woman for the purpose of procreation and the rearing of children and mutual assistance\". It is \"the approved social pattern whereby two or more persons establish a family\" (Waruta 2013, 102). For Mwandayi (2017, 2), marriage is the cog around which life in an African society revolves, the absence of which there is no society to talk about, no reason to live for and no future to talk about.  Mwandayi's (2017) explanation of marriage captures the essence and weight attached to marriage and the extent of what it means for Africans. Creating a sustainable future through marriage, as Mwandayi suggests, is an act of partnership with God in creation.   It is a partnership which God through the participation of people who enters into a marriage union. A partnership which should be characterised by mutuality, respect and love. In other words, this should defeat any sign of negative cultural ideologies which may attempt to denigrate other person. This brings me to Mbiti's (1969, 133) classical definition of marriage as the central point of focus in relations to marriage and African culture: he views marriage as \"a drama in which everyone becomes an actor or actress and not just a spectator\". Mbiti uses a theatrical analogy to drive his point on how a marriage union should be approached and understood. The analogy best describes the notion of marriage in way that depicts two individuals complementing each other in the theatre of marriage. A key point in this analogy, is on the complementarity that marriage act brings or shows through the two characters. In the process, Mbiti's definition does not encourage spectatorship, but coordination in way that gives freedom to the individuals playing.   Mbiti (1969, 130) regards marriage as \"a rhythm of life in which everyone must participate\". At the heart of Mbiti's definition lies an ideal of equality in",

        "sentence_chunk": "marriage.   However, this equality is not characterised by any forms of masculinity and manhood ideologies and African cultural norms in terms of sociological constructs of gender roles.   Mbiti's definition is more than an ideal vision of married life. If two people are to perform on stage without the disturbance and interference of outside forces, both performers must be able create inner harmony and complementary balance that promotes healthy relations. The problem here is that marriage does not happen outside the bounds of culture, which also includes norms. While norms vary between different ethnicities, they have the potential to influence how marriage should be viewed within a society. While the spectators should allow the performance to unfold without interference, it is possible for a performer to be an actor and a spectator at the same time. This is caused by the fact that norms come with social expectations which then dictate how a woman and a man should behave in their marital union. Some of the expectations border on toxic masculinity and the maintenance of male authoritarian headship in the house. Within the African cultural context, this attitude influences domestic violence, oppression, domination and exploitation of women (Mshweshwe 2020).  Mbiti's vision of marriage - as a drama to be enacted by both individuals equally - may be faced with resistance as it will frustrate the agenda of masculinity. And because of this, it becomes difficult if not impossible for women to participate freely as equal partners with men in marriage. If a marriage is to be enacted as a drama on stage, two people must play in a delicate and complementary way that not only shows respect and love for each other but also respects the rights of individuals in totality. Masenya (2016, 364) raises a similar point that \"a husband and a wife should exude a spirit of mutuality and complementarity rather than a competitive spirit\". She goes on to state that: \"If any marriage or family is to flourish, both husband and wife should jointly work together for the welfare of such institutions\" (Masenya 2016, 364). This play would help in demolishing the dominant masculinity and manhood ideologies which should be defeated by the couple from inside and on the stage itself. While active spectators cheer from the gallery, they should be able to observe the oppressive ideologies and oppose such indefinitely. In this way, Mbiti's definition or vision of marriage would become meaningful and more real rather than remain a theoretical concept. Nevertheless, within the African context, marriage has always been viewed as an inseparable institution from cultural and traditional value systems (Emelone 2020). While much of African society believes that the core foundations of marriage are primarily about procreation and nurturing children, it is also about the culture of two different families, their tradition and their religion. These are issues to be dealt with in a way that provides a fair balance between the couple. Marriage finds its meaning and relevance within the confines of different African indigenous cultural affiliations. In other words, how some African societies view marriage, may differ from how others elsewhere in Africa view it. But where these societies meet without differing, is on the view that marriage is a significant necessity for the sustenance of society. This makes the expectations and roles, particularly played by women, much broader than what would be expected in their family unit.   Such expectations are born from the fact that marriage is intertwined with cultural and traditional expectations for both men and women. Within the cultural and traditional lens through which marriage is understood, the question of manhood plays a pivotal role for many African men. Interpretations of what it means to be a married woman are always explained within the confines of sociological gender constructs. The roles in marital life are played in terms of what society defines as the place for women in marriage. Akurugu, Domapielle and Jatoe (2021, 1821), although writing from the perspectives of the Dagaaba people of northern Ghana, confirm that \"roles, both within the domestic sphere of the home and in the community, are deeply divided along gender lines, with women and men playing distinct ones\". An example of this is the status of being a mother that calls for the expected roles involving love, nurturing, self-sacrifice, home-making, and availability; while the status of being a father calls for the roles of disciplinarian, home technology expert, and ultimate decision maker in the household.   At the heart of these constructs lies a method which men employ to control the marital household, including taking control over women's reproductivity and freedom to contribute to household matters. Such a culture cannot give women full rights and freedom to participate in the drama of marriage. Participation would mean a couple interacting as equal partners despite their cultural or traditional affiliations. While culture is like a fabric which is woven with many shades of colours (Baloyi 2017), those shades should not be to the detriment of women. The custodians of culture should not be decorating culture at the expense of the rights of women in marriage. Marriage is not a means within which women's voices are silenced based on the male-female hierarchical order debate (Ruether 2002), which denies women the rights and opportunity to speak freely without prejudice. The institution of marriage ought to provide space for the partners to have total freedom to act to the maximum of their abilities.   ## African Cultural Hermeneutics  Within the discourse of theology, there are several African women theologians across the continent who write intensely on the issue of women's emancipation and the need for a contextual hermeneutical approach to African situations. These women theologians, such as Mercy Oduyoye, Isabel Phiri, Musimbi Kanyoro, Madipoane Masenya, Teresa Okure and Esther Mombo, to mention a few, have done well in paving a path to a healthy discussion about the problem of patriarchy, manhood and masculinity within the limits of African cultural norms and value systems. They see the discussion on hermeneutics as necessary for the fulfilment of women's rights, freedom and dignity in all aspects of life. While it remains necessary for people to have culture, its ideologies should not be allowed to create hardship for women in marriage.   The bible is a document which many have been used to advance the agenda of males at the expense of women's freedom and rights in marriage. This is further complemented by the sociological constructs on gender roles which favour men over women. In most situations where women are oppressed, masculinity and manhood are found to be centre, however, using culture as a shield to hide behind when delivering toxicity. Kanyoro (1995, 18) states that \"culture is something subconscious, so ingrained in us that we do not hear or see ourselves within our cultural skin\". In other words, some men employ their toxic masculinity consciously, while others may find themselves doing so unconsciously. Cultural hermeneutics helps in identifying certain aspects of culture that help to perpetuate toxic masculinity and other oppressive issues against women. This should help in the process of searching for a female face of God through analysing cultural practices which are oppressive and denigrative to the personhood of women. Kanyoro  (1995, 22) further states that dealing with issues that oppress women in marriage requires collective solidarity. Cultural hermeneutics argues for a collective reflection to help build a just society. According to Kanyoro (1995, 23), \"Building that \u2026 [society]  does not begin by attacking men but by finding methods of bringing change together with them\". Within the theological environment, it is necessary to make use of this hermeneutical model but then to take a praxis approach. Adamo (2016, 1) is in agreement with Kanyoro that, when we discuss the hermeneutic(s) that can transform Africa we are discussing the biblical studies",

        "sentence_chunk": "that are vital to the well-being of our society. This can be called African cultural hermeneutics.  This cultural hermeneutical method has the potential to enable dialogue and pave the way to a better future in which partnerships between men and women would be incorporated. Phiri (2007, 155) argues that the \"process of reading the Bible that empowers women should begin by identifying the contextual challenges that oppress women-child marriage, exclusion from education and other forms\". For Adamo (2016, 1), \"African cultural hermeneutics or African Biblical Studies has three main characteristics: It is 'liberational, transformational and culturally sensitive'\". Adamo raises an important point in his argument. When we engage in the process of exposing the toxicity that lies behind African culture, it is important to remember that the action should be purely liberative and transformative. The process should also be sensitive in that, dealing with culture that is intertwined with masculinity and manhood ideologies and thus can cause challenges, particularly for those who are custodians of culture.   While I acknowledge the significance of African culture in defining who people are in terms of their cultural affiliations, its prime existence cannot be made a tool to oppress others. It cannot be made a vehicle within which to drive others (women in particular) to hell while in their respective families and societies. It cannot be used as a method to reduce the essence of another person's value. Their human right and dignity cannot be violated and reduced on the basis of protecting and promoting the masculinity and manhood ideologies hidden behind culture. The beauty of this cultural hermeneutics is that it acknowledges that culture is not a static phenomenon but changeable over time.   This is supported by Maluleke and Nadar (2002) in that the fact that culture is not static, signifies that parts of it can be removed. However, there is need for collective solidarity between men and women in the process of dismantling those aspects of culture which carry many toxic masculinity and manhood ideologies. Kanyoro (1995, 22) argues that \"cultural oppression cannot be addressed in singular. Since the custodians of indigenous cultures often have little contact with other cultures, a valid analysis must include their views\". Thus, cultural hermeneutics must become a way of theologising justice to the unjust systems under masculinity and manhood. Whether it is in the institution of marriage or not, cultural hermeneutics should make the custodians of cultures realise that culture exist among people for identity purposes.   Furthermore, for culture to exist, it must first be coined and defined by people who will use it as their tool of identity. It becomes people's way of life where future generations learn about their identity, norms and values. Cultural hermeneutics requires theologians and clergy to teach and unearth aspects that are hegemonic for the future generations of Africa. If marriage and culture are to be taken as inseparable, then those negative aspects which make women fail to participate as equal partners with men in marriage should be removed. It should promote the idea of partnership in marriage which will help fight the sociological gender constructs which subject women to cultural oppression.   ## Conclusion  Despite the challenges mentioned in the article, the institution of marriage and family remains the most valuable institution in the African context. While there is an intersection between the institution of marriage and African culture, all forms of masculinity employed to oppress women should not be given space to continue with the injustices they impose on women. Cultural hermeneutics aims at building a sound society which provide conducive environment for women in all spheres of their lives.   Through the cultural dialogue, cultural hermeneutics should be able to provide African societies with a future where both women and men can be friends and enjoy the positive aspects afforded by African cultural values. However, building that future does not begin by attacking each other, but by reasoning together to find a suitable method in bringing about change.  Kanyoro (1995, 22), when speaking from a biblical point of view and in search of cultural hermeneutics, indicates that our concern with biblical text is not just to condemn the culture but to seek tools to analyse culture in order to reach out to women who are in bondage to it.  I am in agreement with Kanyoro that such tools must include awareness of those who continue to promote and protect the toxic aspects of culture. If any marriage or family is to flourish, both husband and wife should work together as equal partners for the wellbeing of their marriage.   ## References  Adamo, D.

Marriage is a universal cultural institution; however, its forms differ from society to society and from religion to religion. Every cultural society has a specified 132 | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.     marriage method that requires its members to observe specific customs and taboos as a necessity of a lawful marriage. According to Mibang and Behera (2006), marriage is not a stand-alone institution but rather a reflection of a people's culture. Marriage ceremonies are not independent but are typically tied to anation's greater cultural past. Marriage is still regarded as a culturally common institution, which indicates that it remains an institution of society in practically all civilizations, despite the fact that marriage rites, traditions, and duties change from country to country. Marriage practices and rituals have always played a major role in shaping the culture and identity of a people. Marriage globally has been undergoing many fundamental changes and transformations in its structure and function. In every community and generation, there are noticeable changes as well as continuities that characterize the institution of marriage.  Abagusii of western Kenya had a marriage culture that was so dynamic. It was interwoven around aspects such as marriage transactions like bridewealth and relationships between the families in marriage (Ochieng, 1974). Indigenous Gusii customs regarded marriage as an alliance between two kinship groups and not only two persons. The bond in marriage, its nature and stability could be related to the perception that marriage binds two families together, forming an integral part of the kinship system as a whole (Hakansson, 2019). The relationship between a man and a woman in marriage was interwoven with marriage transactions, which gave rise to reciprocal rights and obligations that bound this alliance. Marriage was seen as sacred to everyone in the community. It was a divine institution that was interwoven with consequences upon breaking the union. Traditional Abagusii thought marriage was a link that connected the community from a known past to an unknown future (Akama, 2017). Like other African families, the family structure was so dynamic that some customs permitted a wider conversation before choices were made. Marriage was a social, economic, and cultural tie that was tied to the couple's cultural and historical background. Such a tie could be broken with the approval of families and relatives, making its dissolution more unlikely. The fundamental family structure was a branch of the extended family that served as an umbrella over the young families, forging a strong tie of solidarity in the process.  ## Methodology  The research took place among the Gusii of Kenya.   It focused mainly on the marriage culture of the Abagusii in the colonial period. The research utilized a descriptive research design. The tools of data collection included oral interviews and archival data. Data was quantitatively analyzed and given a historical interpretation. This involved a systematic approach to organizing and interpreting data into meaningful conclusions that involved patterns, trends or correlations that emerge from the analysis.   The target population included elderly members of society, religious leaders and Gusii cultural leaders.   ## Findings And Discussions  The History of Migration and Settlement of Abagusii The Gusii people, commonly known as Abagusii, are a Bantu-speaking community who occupy the southwest portion of the cool, fertile western section of the Kenyan highlands. They border the Luo to the south, the Kipsigis, and the Maasai to the east and southeast. They are a highly diverse Kenyan ethnic group of the former Nyanza region, currently occupying Kisii, Nyamira, and other parts of Kericho and Bomet counties of Kenya's former Rift Valley region. Gusii region is the highest part of the south-Nyanza highlands; it consists of rounded, steep-sided hills intersected by narrow valleys rich in red volcanic soils. There is normally sufficient rainfall, and the area is well served by the tributaries of the three main rivers which flow into Lake Victoria. The highlands cover an area of 2196 sq. km. The climatic conditions allow for a large variety 133 | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.     of crop farming, ranging from tea, coffee, pyrethrum, wheat, maize, and a variety of vegetables and fruits (Silberschmidt, 1999). Just like the Kikuyu, Akamba, Abaluhya, and Abakuria Bantu speakers, the Gusii claim that they originated from ' Misri' to the North of Mount Elgon. Scholars who have studied Abagusii agree that",

        "sentence_chunk": "they must have settled in their present home in the southern highlands approximately two centuries ago. Their first settlement locations were Nyagoe, Manga, and Isecha in the present Kitutu constituencies of Kisii county (Ochieng, 1974). Traces of their migrations can be traced in Kisumo, Kano plains, Nyakach, Nyando, Ruri hills, Gendia, Belgut, Kabianga, and the Transmara triangle. From these primary settlements (Nyagoe, manga, and Isecha), Gusii clans sorted themselves out and expanded into the rest of the highlands (Were &  Nyamwaya, 1986). According to Ochieng, the Maasai, Kipsigis, and Luo were the greatest dangers to the Gusii's existence from the time they settled in their current homeland until the arrival of the British. They attacked the Gusii in their heartland and exercised raiding from them as a lucrative business.   The Gusii settled in the highlands in phases. The first to settle were the Osiango and Sigisa clans, followed by the Abarangi, Abakeboye, Abasamaro, Abanyameuru, and Mwanyamoronge in the present area of North Mugirango. Interestingly, some of these clans have been phased out or absorbed into other clans. According to Gusii traditions, five or seven generations ago, Nyaribari, Bassi, Majoge, and South Mugirango were empty before occupation commenced (Ochieng, 1974). The Gusii highlands influenced the social, political, and economic spheres of their lives. After their arrival, the Gusii turned more and more to cultivation. Each clan had to occupy a ridge or a succession of adjacent ridges claimed by the right of first occupation and clearance of forests or by dislodging the first clans that settled on it. It is also important to note that the Gusii religious ideas played a very fundamental part in welding together the Gusii social structure.  Just before the coming of the Europeans, various themes of conquest, assimilation, and adoption to new environments were featured in Giusii's history  (Ochieng, 1974). These themes were necessitated by the natural struggle to survive in the hills. In the true spirit of shared destiny, the various ethnic groups were highly dynamic, adaptive, innovative, and accommodating. The Gusii was a well-ordered, self-regulatory, self-sufficient society with an inbuilt mechanism for self-perpetuation, production, reproduction, and local initiatives that the colonial intrusion dampened and stifled rather than promoted (Maxon, 1989).  ## The Institution Of Marriage Among The Abagusii In The Pre-Colonial Period  Since arriving in their homeland, the Gusii people have followed several traditions, just like the other ethnic groups in Kenya. The populace revered these traditions, and to a considerable part, they still are (Okiya, 2016). This indicates that breaking or disobeying a custom shows complete disdain for the ancestors and devastates the entire\"community\" (Mwamogusii). Marriage was one of the institutions with such practices. Marriage was regarded as the most important institution in Gusii culture since it was the start of life. The fruit of marriage was thought to be having offspring (Mayer, 1949).  Marriage was seen as an institution to be regarded as sacred by every Gusii. It was a divinely ordained institution regulated with norms that had consequences upon breaking the union. Traditional Abagusii thoughts towards marriage were the link of the eternal chain of existence that stretched from a known past to an unknown future (Levine &  Pfeifer, 1982). It was divinely decreed that no one should intentionally destroy this bond, as it connected the living and the dead. The Abagusii society saw the inhumane treatment of women as a sign of irresponsibility. Polygamy was the gentlest approach for a man who wished to maintain control 134 | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.  over his homestead's deteriorating marital connections. Rather than resorting to severe and brutal measures such as divorce, Abagusii traditional culture believed it was prudent to marry a second wife. This step was viewed as a kind of rehabilitation or a lesson to the first wife to rectify herself (Maxon, 1989). The second or even third wife's marriage preserved the first wife's image and reputation, which would have been otherwise ruined by divorce.  In situations where women could not meet the sexual desires of men, it was only natural for men to remedy the problem by marrying a second woman to avoid marital conflicts that could develop from sexual dissatisfaction. Elders from the Abagusii community who heard similar complaints from a man with high sexual drive advised him to marry a second wife and refrain from enjoying marital ties with his first wife. Married women were never sent away for the mere reason of not satisfying the sexual desires of their husbands. In such cases, both husband and wife would strike a balance and bring in the second or third wife. The first wife would take care of the welfare and other duties of the family, and the second wife would take care of the sexual demands of the husband (Okeno, 2014).  From birth to death, Abagusii belonged, in a literal sense, to his family, clan, and ethnic group (Ochieng, 1974). All communal activities were collectively performed harmoniously in a spirit of togetherness. Collective responsibility was to ensure the community had enough security, understanding, and fellowship. Without this, there was danger and misfortunes from enemies and their surrounding communities. Many were the devices that bound the community together, and amidst them was marriage. The life and essence of the Abagusii community mainly rested in marriage, with its day-to-day experience and expectations of its members. According to Professor Ogot, \"the dominating realities of traditional life lie first in the security of familial succession and second in the tight relationships of all patterns of conduct,\" which has evolved as a way of life meant to secure the group's survival (Orera, 2023).  The married Gusii individuals were obligated to follow certain cultural norms. Within marriage, there was a socially acceptable code of behaviour.  Gusii's marital connections developed along these lines, which were critical for the stability and survival of their traditions. In marriage, everyone shares common and institutionalized patterns of cooperation and interdependence (Hakansson, 1985). There were well-defined lines of authority along the familial line. With the aid of the clearly defined authority, all conflicts and norm breaches were amicably resolved within the family tree. The homestead head wielded enormous power over his wives, sons, and daughters. His directions on various issues had to be followed (Ochieng, 1974).   The father possessed commanding power to control his wayward sons and daughters, including the ability to discipline his wife. This kept the family ties, and respect for the head of the family was always maintained.  Traditional Abagusii marriage institutions recognized legal marriages only acknowledged if the bride's wealth was paid. The key component of the legality was the payment of goods and services and cooking for the bride's family (done by the bridegroom's household) to show the capability of taking care of the bride once the marriage was done (Akama & Maxon, 2006). Even though Abagusii had a wide range of forms for paying bridewealth, the laws controlling its payment were uniform across the ethnic group. In traditional Abagusii society, marriage connections were viewed as fostering love, peace, harmony, and togetherness within the family of married connections (Nyasani, 1984).   Social justice was guaranteed through the man of the family. The husband ensured his family stayed in peace and harmony, and his children received blessings equally and without discrimination. Justice regarding the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges within a homestead 135 | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.     was witnessed and maintained. Social order and peace prevailed within African polygamous households. In this sense, respect was key, and people feared the",

        "sentence_chunk": "consequences of disrespecting older members of society. This was possible due to the many laws, customs, sets of behaviours, regulations, rules, observances, and taboos constituting the moral code of behaviour around marriage. Some of these laws were regarded sacred and promoted justice among the Abagusii (Silberschmidt, 1999). Abagusii's traditional marriage was interwoven with important aspects such as marriage transactions and relationships.   Indigenous Gusii customs regarded marriage as an alliance between two kinship groups, not just two persons. Marriage relations, their nature, and stability could be related to the perception that marriage binds two families together, forming an integral part of the kinship system as a whole. Within this framework, a conception of marriage was interwoven with marriage transactions, giving rise to reciprocal rights and obligations that bound this system (Shaddle, 2006). This idea of a continuing relationship tied together various facets of marriage, including bridewealth, aspects of levirate marriages, and sororate conditions, all of which contributed to marriage's significance. Such ideas, laws, and customs were passed down from generation to generation, becoming the core tradition of the Gusii.  ## Traditional Socio-Religious Aspect Of The Gusii Marriage  Marriage was a holy institution for the Gusii indigenous people, intimately linked to the Gusii traditional religion. It was more of a process than a single event that signified one's passage from one stage of life to the next; it entailed years of rites, agreements, and transactions. It was a communal activity through which a community's ideals were developed and perpetuated. Marriage among the Abagusii was highly socio-religious. It was the primary focus of the existence of the community.   Through the permanent and harmonious marital posterity, the Gusii remembered the dead and anticipated the unborn future generation. According to Otoigo, one of the informants: Marriage was sacred, and every normal Gusii freely and with joy participated in it. Failure to do this was a deliberate stop of the continuous free flow of\"obogima (Life\" *through* individuals. This meant wiping the community from the earth. The ancestors would never be happy with us if we did thi\" (I. Otoigo, Personal Communication, December 25, 2021).  Parents were considered foundations of traditional Abagusii beliefs, which was why newborns were named after the deceased members of the family unit. Many of the newborns could acquire similar names to their ancestors. Many men aged 55 years and above were called Nyabuto, a famous Gusii family man and colonial chief. Abagusii believed that marriage was even in the land of the living dead  (Silberschmidt, 1999). The idea of life after death was conscious in the minds of the community. For that reason, a couple lived together harmoniously, and after death, they were buried side by side so that they would continue living their happy life wherever they were. Marriage was a lawful and socially accepted transitional ceremony in which a man and a woman consented to live together as husband and wife to reproduce due to parental permission and completion of societal standards. A marriage between a man and a woman legitimized sexual access, and the children born as a consequence were automatic members of the lineage and community at large (Ochieng, 1974).  As a result, marriage played an important role in Gusii's culture and religious heritage. It was a community activity that shaped and sustained community values. Marriage acted as an insurance against evils such as witchcraft in that whenever such vices were common, many children acted as a surety to propagate the lineage (Okiyah, 2016). The Gusii lineage, leadership, adulthood, elderhood, 136 | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.     bridewealth, polygamy, herbalism, and community continuity were all related to marriage in one way or another. Marriage encompassed the most important concepts and values that brought human life together and into harmony. Before the era of colonial rule in the highlands, men and women had their familial identities well spelled out. The roles of both genders were clearly defined and acknowledged. It was the responsibility of every woman to give birth and raise children. They also took care of farm operations to yield food for the family.   ## The Role Of Abagusii Traditional Rites On Marital Stability In The Pre-Colonial Period Up To 1895  Marriage among the Gusii was a community affair with several rites and customs. The proper adherence to such rites made marriage meaningful and considered a significant stage of Giusii's life  (Okiya, 2016). Adhering to such rites made marriage be referenced by many for a long period.   The marriage institution was only enriched and strengthened through participation in the various marriage rites. Abagusii, just like other Bantu communities of western Kenya, actively engaged in various marriage ceremonies. It involved all community members, both the living and the ancestors. Upholding cultural rites associated with marriage kept the community together and supported the community in growing its rich cultural base. The various rites that included initiation, mentorship to adulthood, courtship, aided partner search (chisigani), wrestling matches, weddings, and post-wedding marriage rituals sustained marriage. It was through such celebrations and communal support that marriage sustainability was realized.   Since marriage was considered the most important thing in Giusii's life, many rites were attached to ensure survival. Among the Abagusii, only some people could get into marriage by passing through almost all the rites and rituals attached to it. The upholding of such rituals was believed to help sustain marriage even later in life. A period of courtship was essential in every Gusii marriage. The period lasted for a short time because it entirely depended on the information gathered from the gobetween (design). During this period, the two main steps entailed partner search and bride introductions (ekerorano). These steps involved certain rituals that included visitations, introductions, feastings, further spying, and investigations of the two families (Nyamache & Asatsa, 2022).  The parents of the groom would identify a gobetween (design). He or she was a trusted neighbour or relative and could be sent to assist in searching for a suitable girl for marriage. Ladies with good reputations attracted many suitors and were wellspoken everywhere. A lady was supposed to be good-looking, hardworking with a good sexual reputation (not sexually promiscuous), not highly tempered, and whose family history had no taint. According to Omeke, go-betweens could try to inquire about bridal virginity (ogwekunga) and the groom's sexual ability. They checked if the families were witches or thieves or had a history of laziness or scars on their bodies. The existence of such scars, particularly those resulting from burns, was sometimes seen as parenting carelessness, which could not be taken lightly. Abagusii believed in the inheritance of weaknesses in habits, and this could affect one's attraction to marriage (N. Omeke, Personal Communication, December 26, 2021). Inlaws, visitations, and introductions were other important marriage rites. This ceremony was commonly known as *ekerorano.* The accompanying feasts known as eating and drinking of in-laws  (ekeri-boko) were done after a deal had been stricken for marriage engagements. Much feasting was done, especially in the evenings, followed by dancing, drinking, and festivity. At this point, goat meat was served, and no chicken meat could be placed on the table. According to Otiso, an elderly among the Gusii, the in-laws to be were treated with honour with goat meat and other drinks. Eating chicken meat was taboo for in-laws, for it was considered disrespectful. However, they were 137 | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.  served chicken to test if the in-laws strictly adhered to Gusii customs. If they",

        "sentence_chunk": "ate the chicken, the relationship may, in the future, have problems  (Otiso, 2021).  After various engagements, bride price negotiations, and payments, a wrestling match (enyameni) was organized between the groom's men and the bride's side. Music done by the harp (obokano) ushered in the wrestling. The wrestling was only meant to increase the bond between the two parties. The winning team was given a bull for slaughter. A pre-wedding ceremony was then arranged, commonly known as *ekeragerio.* This big celebration was organized at both the bride's and groom's homes. These days were always set apart and attended by nearly all community members to show how important marriage was to the community. Women and men older in age advised the parties planning to get married on how to conduct themselves in marriage. It was through such advice that the stability of marriage was reassured. After the pre-wedding, the bride was escorted to the groom's place, handed over ceremoniously to his wedded man, and was cautioned not to break the bond. This was commemorated by knot-tying by both the groom and the bride. The knot was an eternal chain that bound the two parties together.   The wedding symbols (ebitwanga, editing, website) marked the seal of an eternal tie. This tie could be removed in case of death or, sometimes, in rare cases, divorce. After the wedding, many rituals accompanied to cement the relationship. The mealsharing feasts by both families, commonly known as *Obokima,* were held a few days after the wedding.   The main agenda of this feast was to find out the welfare of the bride in her new home. Newborn celebrations, commonly known as *ekerero,* accompanied other post-wedding rituals. It is through such shared activities that helped to build strong marital bonds among the Gusii. Marriage breakups, rivalry within marriage, and contestations of gender roles were rare when many traditional marriage rites were followed and referenced (Nyamache & Asatsa, 2022).   ## The Role Of Initiation In The Marriage Of The Abagusii In The Pre-Colonial Period  Initiation was an essential traditional ritual that marked the transition from childhood to maturity.   Abagusii believed in a strong link between marriage and initiation. This practice had several implications for the community and the initiates involved. Among the Gusii, circumcision rituals were held yearly compared to other ethnic groups, with an interval of three to five years. The age of circumcision of both boys and girls ranged between 16-20 years. The ceremonies were held after the main harvest from October to December. After the operations, the initiates could stay in a special house during the period of seclusion commonly known as*\"bware.*\" During this period, the initiates were taught and prepared for marriage. After circumcision, the initiates (boys and girls) were given a bunch of *ekerundu* grass (a common symbol of fertility) to hold in their right hand, a sign of preparedness to sire children. Songs of *timbre* were sung to praise their bravery. Later, washing hands and applying caustic ash as a part of the cleansing was done (Orera, 2023).  During induction into the seclusion hut, the Gusii performed a formal ceremony. The initiates and their tutors were covered by a blanket when they entered the homestead and proceeded toward the seclusion hut. The father of the initiates had invites who awaited around the cattle pen (many of whom were elders) to bless the young man. They held a calabash with milk, indicating the desire of many cattle and women for the initiative. Afterwards, rejoicing and dance are made after the initiate drinks the milk. The circumcision song's *timbre was* sung as the initiates went for seclusion. Inside the hut, a fire had been lit with traditional firesticks. The instructor had to ensure the fire went out only when the seclusion was over. The extinguishing of fire slowed the healing process and called for the cleansing ritual. After entering through the main     door, the initiates were not supposed to use it until the end of seclusion. After seclusion ceremonies, the initiates were given a mandate to conquer the world. A famous Gusii proverb was used, orwane mocha na irianyi, signifying that the initiates were now ready to impregnate any girl from any part of the world. They were blessed to marry and begin families. Women's initiation was done due to the belief that it reduced sexual urges in women and would sustain the marriage. In practising female initiation, Abagusii sought to ensure that their women were not promiscuous. Initiation was highly spiritualized, and more rituals accompanied it, including oath-taking. The oath taken was that the initiates were to be true to the traditions and customs of the Gusii. According to Nyamao, upholding cultural traditions was the main reason initiation was practised (O. I Nyamao, 2021). On the other hand, female initiation was considered an integral part of the Gusiipeople's way of life and culture.  \"Boys and girls were circumcised at puberty, which symbolized endurance and a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood. Preserving sexual morality was a fundamental reason for circumcision. Initiates underwent marriage counselling from aunts and uncles, on a commitment to marriage by being faithful, in order to escape curses and harsh punishment, including death that resulted from breaking the marital taboos amasangi (O. I. Gesare, 2021).  The songs and dances performed in these ceremonies were important. The dancers, who comprised young men who had undergone the rituals and girls slightly older than the son undergoing the ritual, coloured the ceremony. The songs were accompanied by drums, commonly known as *the Mekon*g, which, in most cases, is a set of three drummers beating the drums in a certain style. The songs and dances are meant to encourage the son undergoing the ritual to be strong, for strength is a sign of manhood. Also, facing the cut is a sign of great strength and manhood. Blood dripping on the day of circumcision linked the initiates with their god and the forefathers. The physical suffering the initiates underwent readied them for the difficulties they would face in the future. It was believed that the bravery to face circumcision was enough evidence that the initiates could defend their family. A few years after circumcision, the initiates were prepared to get married and establish a family (Shaddle, 2003).   Preparedness took the shape of the division of work at the family level. The dads spent most of their recreational time with their boys, exposing them to manly pursuits. Together, they cared for grazing cattle, hunted in the homes and fields, built structures, fenced the complex, and made defensive tools (Gwako, 1995). This assisted the initiates in cognitively identifying their tasks, culminating in marriage. Moreover, young males were conditioned to believe that females were fragile and required protection, which became their marriage domain.   On the other hand, girls were trained in isolation for domestic chores such as taking care of husbands, midwifery, living together with the in-laws, respecting the father and mothers-in-law, raising children, and behaving in readiness for marriage.   This mirrored how they would act in marriage. Marriage was considered the aim and climax of existence in the community, with all life pointing to it, and the preparations here took on psychological and social aspects.  Both boys and girls went through marital counselling to learn what was anticipated as they matured and how to manage their relationships once married. The agony they felt during circumcision without anaesthesia was intended to train and equip them to withstand hardships as they grew into adults  (Mayer, 1953).  \"They were taught various traditions and how to step into adulthood. They were taught about sexuality, adult roles, hard work, protection, and fending for the family, among other roles.   They underwent marriage counselling from aunts and uncles, on a commitment to marriage by being faithful, in order to escape curses and 139 | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution",

Gesare, 2021).\" All initiates were ready to marry after circumcision. They had everything they needed to raise and care for their family. During the pre-colonial period, this practice was one of the pillars of a powerful marriage system among the Gusii.  ## The Place Of Bridewealth In Gusii Marriage In The Pre-Colonial Period  The Abagusii concept of bridewealth, just like many other Bantu communities in western Kenya, was motivated by noble and genuine necessity rather than because of malicious profiteering. Bridewealth did not mean an element of purchase or selling of the bride. The purchase element may have been introduced later after the coming of the British. The term\"chiomb\" was used by the Gusii to mean bridewealth. Marriage became legitimate only if there was an exchange of bridewealth (O.I  Mwembi, 2021). The payment of bridewealth in the pre-colonial period was exclusively made through the remittance of cows, goats, and sheep. Cattle, bridewealth, and marriage were inseparable forms of determining the success of the whole community.   Bridewealth had an important social, economic, and religious significance. Through the bride's wealth, a new relationship was formed between the two families. Abagusii believed that a marriage without payment of bridewealth was like cohabiting with a woman as a concubine. A man had no claim over a woman unless he had paid the bridewealth. Upon the payments, all children born of the marriage belonged to the husband's family. Among the Gusii, bridewealth was usually paid as livestock (O.I  Mwembi,2021). The average full bridewealth for Gusii marriage was between 10-15 heads of cattle, three goats, and other gifts (KNA/SK/3/3/2). Only cattle were counted as bridewealth. The goats were slaughtered in pre and after-wedding ceremonies. Bridewealth was, therefore, a cornerstone of the Gusii marriage, hence the common saying\"no bridewealth, no marriage. The Gusii culture demanded dowry negotiations and payments prior to the wedding day. However, based on the understanding of the two families, part of the wealth could be paid, and the remaining amount completed later.  Marriage was inseparable from the bridewealth (O.I, Motieri,2021). The legality of any marriage was evidence of cattle transactions with the bride's parents. This transfer significantly linked two families. It also meant security of land rights to the woman married in her new home and, most importantly, gave the man a right to sire children with the woman. Traditionally, parents and relatives of the respective bridegroom and bride had an important role in marriage negotiations concerning bridewealth. It was an important source of prestige for the elders in that they controlled and determined the amount of bridewealth remitted. According to Omariba, bridewealth always stayed within some limits.  \"Exchanges of \"chiombe\" (bridewealth) never exceeded some limits. Usually, *a certain* number of cows agreed by elders of both sides were given to secure a girl for marriage. Where the *bridegroom's side felt burdened with the* amount, they easily pulled out from the transactions. This could paint a bad image of the bride's family. This was avoided as much for it meant that the family could not easily get sons-in-law (Abako) (O.I Omariba, 2021).\" Mayer records that in some instances, women fetched a higher bridewealth than expected because of their desired traits and if they had attracted multiple suitors for marriage. Women who had given birth while in the father's home fetched fewer cattle for bridewealth. Some fathers willingly accepted fewer cattle, especially when their daughters had long stayed without getting married or if the father preferred the suitor to marry his daughter. Nevertheless, even if this was so, recordings from the Kisii district, especially those referring to the pre-colonial period, show a range of 140 | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.     10-15 herds of cattle given for bridewealth (Mayer, 1950).  Bridewealth in Kisii term meant\"exchange.\" According to Moraa, bridewealth was meant to replace the workforce that had left the village.  Cattle got from marrying our daughters and replaced them by bringing in ladies to help us with farm labour. If the Mzee was not old, we proposed to her a woman to marry to increase labour in our farms. If the Mzee was old, then his sons were given\"chiombe chio omoisek\" (bridewealth *from a daughter) to marry* (O.I Moraa, 2021) Young men of marriageable ages looked to their sisters' bridewealth to enable them to get married. This meant that fathers accepted a specific amount of cattle (between 10-15) to enable their sons to get married with ease. Every family brought up their demands, but there was always a go-between (Omogayani) who always helped these families settle down on a reasonable amount of bridewealth. After reaching a consensus, the elders ate happily and drank beer. This was a sign of making peace between the families. If there was no consensus arrived at, the bridegroom's elders could not accept any meal or beer. This was a demonstration of their frustration. They could request time to think about the laid demands. If the woman to be married had desirable qualities, they could come again for negotiations.   ## Role Of Patriarchy In Marriage Among The Abagusii In The Pre-Colonial Period  Abagusii had been traditionally structured around the idea of patriarchy, which is the belief that men are the heads of the household and have authority over their families. Patriarchal marriage was based on the idea that the husband was the authority figure in the home and was responsible for making decisions about the family's finances, the upbringing of the children, and the choice of a potential bride or groom for his children (Hakansson, 1994). This type of marriage structure was an important part of Gusii culture and was believed to promote stability and order within the family. It also provided a framework for the husband and wife to work together to provide for their family and ensure their children were well looked after. Furthermore, it was believed that this type of marriage structure protected the woman and her rights and promoted a sense of respect and honour for maleness in marriage. Abagusii had traditionally built their identity along patriarchal lines. The role of patriarchy in Abagusii marriage was strong and inherent. Marriage was seen as a way for a man to increase his wealth and status (Hakansson, 1985). Gusii men were expected to provide for and protect their wives and were typically seen as the heads of the households.  On the other hand, women were expected to obey their husbands, remain faithful and bear children. Gusii's concept of marriage was seen as a way of consolidating wealth and power within the community. Men were expected to marry many wives, and the more wives they had, the more power and influence they had in the community. On the other hand, women were expected to be loyal to their husbands and were not allowed to marry outside their own Gusii clan. Marriage was allowed between certain totems (sub-clans) of the Gusii community (Levine, 1966).  Abagusii culture demarcated men's and women's roles in marriage; males were the heads, and women adopted subservient positions. Aside from farm labour, women's tasks included sexually satisfying their men, cooking for them, and bearing children  (Silberschmidt, 1999). Male and female responsibilities were clearly defined. According to Silberschmidt (2001), while patriarchal thought was lived and reflected in the lives of men and women in Gusii, this did not imply that all men were effective patriarchs or that all women were obedient.  On the surface, Kisii households were predominantly male-dominated. Patriarchal rules, 141 | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.  codes of conduct, and beliefs were ordered or left in charge of men.

        "sentence_chunk": "their relationship with men (daughter, sister, wife, and mother), and men were linked to women in the same manner (son, brother, husband, father). Men, unlike women, were also characterized by their duties or statuses, such as head of the family, cattle keeper, elder, and many more (Mayer, 1950). Men who were exclusively the heads of families were also rulers and owners of their own families. They owned all the property within the homesteads  (including women and children) and exercised authority over all internal familial issues, including the relationships and connections with neighbouring families. Every family was accountable to the head of the family in the manner of conduct and social responsibilities. The man assigned duties that ranged from livestock herding to crop cultivation and many more responsibilities. Every family member was expected to take on these responsibilities cheerfully and without complaint.   Each family endeavoured to increase its membership in order to increase farm labour. This drive for numerical expansion of the homestead was a fundamental tendency in the Gusii domestic life  (Levine R and B, 1966).  Male and female realms were physically separated in physical space. Men could not access the rafter storage room where the women kept their pots and threshed grain. Women, on the other hand, were barred from entering the men's houses without permission. There was a clear division of labour between men and women, reflected in two hierarchies. Specific tasks were allocated to just one sex (Levine R and B, 1966). A Man was the only one who could herd the animals. Men erected the timber framework for the huts, while women did the plastering. Males were the only ones who could make ropes or work with iron. Women were the only ones who could cook, care for the house fire, and make beer. Male domination was restricted since society's worldview was based on separating the male and female spheres. Furthermore, because males relied on women for nourishment, women had a counterweight and the power to inflict sanctions on men. Authority was centred on manhood. Solving marriage disputes was exclusively for elders, abanyamaiga. *Etureti* elders and *Egesaku* elders presided over this marriage dispute. Abagambi solved and laid justice in many marriage disputes. Elders were men of regular standing, honest, and kept to themselves secrets of many marriage disputes that were brought to them. Due to the patriarchal nature of the community, most Gusii women feared being divorced or staying without a man (Okeno, 2014). They would rather endure struggles to enjoy the pretentious securities and benefits.  Male headship and women submission were both culturally and religiously inscribed in the lives of the Gusii. This kind of social control penetrated all societal and social institutions, including marriage. Fathers made rules, made decisions, controlled household activities, and provided for the family (Silberschnidt, 2004). Traditional Gusii cultural values had specific perceptions regarding headship and submission in marriage. According to Levine (1966), traditional Gusiisociety's men and women had well-defined roles and obligations that defined their patriarchal nature. There were clear-cut boundaries of ' and and' anddon'tss' with regard to male and female roles. This perceived 'proper way' was taught to children from an early age by word of mouth. Males were welcomed with great excitement even at birth, and the father took immense pleasure and pride in reinforcing the family line's continuation and preserving his possessions. On the other hand, a girl's birth had fewer rites and a lower emphasis placed on the mother. The reception was simple and uninteresting. Men had sole ownership of the land. A woman could get permanent land ownership through marriage but not own land by herself. Nevertheless, she supervised her house's properties and could make independent decisions in day-to-day 142 | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.  activities. The homestead head assigned plots to each woman, but grain generated by a wife or any of her children remained in her house and was kept in her granaries. Furthermore, she might sometimes effectively oppose her husband's policies, such as his attempts to compel livestock loans between families. Her success depended on adult sons, who were usually more attached to their mothers than their fathers. Determining the nature of sons' allegiance to their moms is difficult. According to Mayer (1950), as a mother's age advanced, she obtained greater autonomy in her home affairs and earned her sons' allegiance.  Gusii institutions were not easily differentiated in political, economic, or religious spheres. They were run on patriarchal lines with a reason of respect for men. There was axiomatic respect not only from wives and daughters but also from sons. Men were ever members of the same society, whereas women came from other clans (Levine, 1966). Patriarchy was often seen as a necessary part of the social structure that brought order and stability to the society. It had a role in the effort to create a harmonious society that had clearly defined roles of members of the family. However, it is important to note that among the Abagusii, patriarchy was not oppressive. Women had access to many spheres of life, including farming. It was a structure necessary to bring order and stability to marriage.   ## Polygamy And Its Influence On Marriage  Polygamy was a norm among the Abagusii. It served the interests of both men and women in various circumstances. It served as a guiding concept for family security, stability, progress, and reputation (Hillman & Perry, 1975). Men joined these partnerships to elevate their social, political, and economic position and to project power and prestige. Getting another woman as a wife was a sign of achievement. A man could farm more land, have more daughters who would marry and leave him with more cattle as bridewealth, and have more sons (Levine & Pfeifer, 1982). Polygamy was common in the majority of the homesteads. According to Ogetonto: \"Men were always the heads; they had an average of four wives. Poor men could only keep one or two wives, while the rich had many wives (some even had ten wives). Each wife had her hut and was allocated a piece of land to cultivate. The wives were supposed to live together harmoniously (O. I. OTISO, 2021).  In traditional Abagusii society, marriage was a fundamental concern to more people than potential spouses. Polygamous marriages were preferred among the Gusii and other western Bantu communities. Taking an additional wife was regarded as one of the fundamental indicators of a successfully established Gusii man. Married wives approved of their husbands' taking of additional wives to increase the labour force and productivity. However, no man was allowed to marry before he could prove to take care of and provide for his already-founded family. Abagusii men did not just marry carelessly and irresponsibly (O.I Nyangaresi, 2021). They were aware of the duties and responsibilities that accompanied polygamy, and those who could not manage were shunned away from polygamy.  The polygamous husband was expected to devote equal sexual and economic attention to all his wives, even though this was not always the case, as preferential treatment was sometimes accorded.   This was usually a breeding ground for jealousy and jealousy among married women (co-wives). The first wife enjoyed the highest status, and her house was the largest in the homestead. Many of the husband's personal belongings, such as weapons, stools, beer straws, and medicine, were kept under her watch or in her house. Most of the time, the husband ate in the first wife's hut because a more stable and trustworthy bond linked him than his other wives (Gwako, 1995).   The first wife had some form of authority over the rest of the co-wives. This was evident, especially in     the first years of younger wives' marriage. Before they had permanently established their homes, they cooked, ate, and slept in the first wife's home. Once they were",

        "sentence_chunk": "allocated land and settled in their homesteads, the dominance slowly diminished. The wives jointly cultivated the gardens, beginning with the senior wife's garden. This pleasant stay describes how polygamy contributed to a stable and secure marriage set-up among the Abagusii in the pre-colonial period (Silberschmidt, 1999).  Wife inheritance also contributed to polygamy among the Abagusii (O.I Omeke, 2021). This was done either by individual choice or loyalty to traditions and lineage. Among the Gusii, the sons of the senior wife were also allowed to inherit their deceased father's junior wives. This demonstrated the superiority of the first wife and her sons over the rest of the household. The desire for many children encouraged some Gusii men to venture into a polygamous marriage. Members of the Council of Elders also encouraged some of their colleagues to take up additional wives. In this sense, polygamy served as a strategy of risk aversion and social insurance. Large families enhanced the prestige of Abagusii men. Men with large families were respected and could obtain justice, as they would be feared by people who would not forcefully dare to take their livestock or other things away from them. More children were also seen as economic assets for enhancing the household's productivity. All these aspects influenced Gusii men into polygamous marriages. Some men ended up in polygamous marriages because they impregnated young unmarried girls and were forced to marry them.  Almost every Gusii man aspired to seniority. The men who aggressively wished to obtain a maximum degree of protection within their Gusii community and to attain some influence and prestige aimed at securing themselves more networks of kinship relations. Marrying more wives was one of the men's most common avenues to enhance their statuses and network of kinship relations. All these endeavours were also driven by older men feeling more comfortable with wider groups of people related to them by blood and marriage. It is, therefore, apparent that some polygamous Gusii men critically viewed the social significance of seniority in terms of the accumulation of years and the effective kinship relations one had. This motivated many men to have many wives and live harmoniously with them.   ## Conclusions  As seen from the above discussions, Abagusii marriage was considered a significant institution due to the several roles and purposes it served.   Marriage in traditional Abagusii culture was governed by rigorous regulations, conventions, and expectations rooted in the Abagusii community's traditions. Abagusii had a variety of marital beliefs that appeared to characterize them amid the communities that surrounded them. Marriage was viewed as a relationship that promoted peace, love, harmony, and togetherness in the family. These ties were intertwined with marriage contracts, which resulted in reciprocal rights and duties that tied the system together. Marriage, according to Abagusii, was an eternal and ever-present bond between the past and the future. Polygamy became popular as a means of perpetuating the community's generations as a result of this.  Abagusii traditional culture had various laws, traditions, and sets of behaviours, regulations, rules, observances, and taboos, all contributing to the moral code of behaviour surrounding marriage. Every member of society was expected to marry, and whenever disagreements, disputes, or misunderstandings happened, the heads of households dealt with them. Abagusii relied heavily on principles drawn from their cultural beliefs for cohesiveness and sustainability within marriage.   With strict adherence to the Gusii customs, beliefs, and rituals, every marriage was to be peaceful and without many disputes and contestations. Abagusii pre-colonial marriage culture was interwoven around important aspects such as marriage 144 | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.     transactions like bridewealth and relationships between the families in marriage. The strict observance of Abagusii culture concerning marriage brought order and stability to the precolonial Gusii community.   According to the Social constructivism theory, marriage in the pre-colonial Abagusii society was seen as the foundation of their society. It was a relationship that defined and united people of different sexes. Marriage defined social interactions and served other important functions that harmonized the community. The next chapter examined the encounter and influence of Christianity and Western culture on Gusii marriage.   ## References  Akama, J. S. (2017).

The study examined the indigenous Nandi family, polygamous Nandi household setup, extended family, the clan, incest, and sexual relationships, responsibilities and rights of household members. It also analyzed the relationships of production, reproduction and distribution, and an analysis of their built forms and settlement.    \u00a9 2017 **Elixir All rights reserved.**  ## 1.1 Introduction  This paper examines the pre-colonial Nandi marriage system and family relationships. This section deals with the following subtopics; indigenous Nandi Kinship and marriage system, the family, sexual relationships, responsibilities, and rights of family members. It also covers relations of production, reproduction and distribution, access to factors of production, access to resources and means of biological reproduction. It includes the Nandi social and political divisions, other beliefs among the Nandi and conclusion to the chapter. This section is relevant to the study because it analyses the indigenous household practices and relationships among the Nandi The functional approach to the household associated with Bronislaw Malinowski (1884 - 1942)  assumed that all cultural traits serve basic or derived needs of individuals in society. To serve these requirements, individuals had to create appropriate strategies to realise their aims. These requirements among others were: nutrition, physical comfort, relaxation, growth, movement, safety, and reproduction. According to him, secondary needs developed in the process of meeting the basic needs.1 Radckuffe Brown (1881 - 1955) was the proponent of structural-functionalist family approach. He attests that human social behaviour was a product of the cultural traits. A family then was the logical product of marriage consisting of a man, his wife, and child or children. By this, childless marriage was not a family.2It does not matter whether marital relationships were permanent or temporary, whether there was polyandry or sexual license, whether extended, one fact stands out beyond all others that everywhere the husband, wife and immature children constitute a family from the remainder of the community.3 The Nandi way of doing this was either the grouping of the so-called nuclear family where the husband, wife, and children relationship were essential but rather the gathering of the extended kindred group consisting of close relatives.  ## 1.2 Indigenous Nandi Kinship, Marriage, And Religion. 1.2.1 The Family.  The English word \"family\" originates from the Latin familia, meaning \"household\". Lewis Henry Morgan attempted to trace the origin of the family and came up with a theory which views with contempt by many anthropologists. He argued that there be a close relationship between different cultural patterns and technological changes. The family according to Morgan started as a crowd living in promiscuity with no sexual regulations and inhibitions. It followed incestuous relationships between brothers and sisters. The third stage was characterised by group marriage while the fourth stage coincided with barbarism. It involved loosely paired male and female, but each could live with other people. The fifth step was husband ruling family in which the husband was polygamous, and finally, the stage of civilisation heralded monogamous family. It was an evolutionary approach which influenced the ideas of communist ideology about property and family as stipulated by Marx and Engels The functional approach to the household associated with Bronislaw Malinowski (1884 - 1942) assumed that all cultural traits serve basic or derived needs of individuals in society. To serve these requirements, individuals had to create appropriate strategies to realise their aims. These requirements among others were: nutrition, physical comfort, relaxation, growth, movement, safety, and reproduction.   According to him, secondary needs developed in the process of meeting the basic needs.   Having a family or marrying in Nandi context was an economic and social affair. A Nandi man did not marry for love, but for specific social reasons: a man must have somebody who could bear him children and help him with work which was not \"man\"s work.\"4 There was plenty of sexual freedom before marriage and though a Nandi had a girlfriend before the wedding, this girl hardly, if ever, became 49210   113 his wife. Subject to clan system, a man would marry any woman who was not a family member or a close relative.5 Among the Nandi, marriage (*Katunisiet*) was the term referring to all marriage rituals in total and a particular stage in marriage ceremonies. *Katunisiet* was the chief marriage ceremony among the Nandi and Kalenjin as a whole. It happened after the whole cattle dowry have been paid and satisfied. However, there were cases when a girl was eloped and married the same night after circumcision. It was a particular instance.   Oral sources confirm that Nandis have intermarried with Kipsigis, Keiyo, Terik, Maasai and other Kalenjin neighbours in ancient European settlements. It means that their marriage borrowed much from these friends or intermarriages.   Geographically, Nandi lived in a more suitable place for interaction and cultural borrowing.6 Among the Keiyo of Kenya, *Katunisiet* was the third in a series of marriage rituals and occurred in the eighth or ninth month of the woman\"s first pregnancy. Among the Marakwet, Katunisio was the second and primary stage which took place after the birth of a child.7Similarly, the Kipsigis way of marriage was a bit different; *Katunisiet* was a beer and food festival which took place many months and possibly years after the giving of the cattle which in turn took place three or much more after the initial binding of the couple.8 1.2.2 **Polygamous Nandi household Setup** Polygamy is a general term referring to multi-spouse relationships for both men and women, but in this study, it means one man is marrying more than one wife (Polygyny). It was prestigious among the Kalenjin peoples and up to 1970\"s, and 1980\"s married Nandi people still practised it. Each wife had her field, cattle, and house within the family compound. A Nandi proverb asserts Mawendi *songo* chepyoso! \"No woman will be unmarried in her lifetime.\"9 The first wife is the chief wife10 in the family. The other women were meant to expand the family.11 Polygamy assisted in the realisation of this proverb as the tribe knew not bachelors or spinsters. It was a bad idea for one not to get married; it is like a curse. The unmarried were only the barren ones.12 A Nandi man could marry many wives as much as his wealth could afford. For a man to have two or three wives was familiar, and three and more was relatively rare. Hollis in his works records that he knew a Kipsigis *Laibon* to have had twenty-eight women and wealthy Nandi reputedly as many as forty wives.13 A man sought the approval of his chief or first wife before marrying the second or subsequent wives. It was one woman who chose another one. This practice was meant to cultivate a quiet and peaceful systemization of the family.   The eldest son of the chief wife is the senior son of the household. Each wife had her house and wealth from which she brought up her family and the husband visited his wives consistently.  According to an oral interview with Francis C. Ruto, the researcher collected the following information: \"Polygyny was part of Nandi culture. Its origin dates back to the Stone",

        "sentence_chunk": "Age period about five hundred years back. The reason behind many wives was wealth. Acquiring wealth was a prestigious issue. The more wives one had was a sign of richness. This richness was regarding cattle, sheep, and goats. Another reason which led to many women had its origin in early childhood up to the late adolescent stage when a handsome boy could be followed and loved by many girls. The boy could have been a good singer, good soloist, the best hunter, and warrior or able-bodied regarding physical appearance\".14 When one was ready for marriage, this was at the age of 30 - 35 years of age; his father prepared an auspicious occasion for his son. The father paid all the dowry, and in some cases, if this son had acquired some personal wealth (cattle) one cow could be added to the father\"s dowry.   The ceremony for the first wife was vital to this family.  This woman was given a unique name in the household as Jepkorek kutwo. Kutwet *or kutwo* was a kind of special hat that warriors wore on their heads. It meant that this wife changed the young hero and made him a husband and king post of his house. All the tools associated with heroes, wars are put aside, and this was the woman who could make him down the tools officially.   The downing of *kutwet* with its associated tools signified that one had become boiyo *or manong'ot*. It meant that one was now a man or husband in his house. The husband now could be given a bed referred to as *itogut. Itogut* made one to sire his children according to the tradition. *Itogut* was a traditional bed or sleeping place of dignity situated within the front section of a Nandi hut.   The newly married wife could command the husband while downing the tools to sit down and start bearing children; she said that 'tebe yu ak *isigisie'* meaning \"sit here and take children\". This command was honoured and made one respectable in the society. This first wife was branded more names denoting her significant responsibility in the home. Another name was *Jepnyogat;* this meant that the lady who was the first to step the homestead. This first woman founded the family, and all family affairs originated from this house. Even her first son was next to the husband, and the husband walked hand in hand with this firstborn son. The couple shaved their hair when they got married as a sign of legitimacy of the marriage.   The second was known as *chemining'wet*, this meant younger wife, the third and all the other women identified as  \"bo bororiet *ak oret'*, ladies of the clan or the community. In Nandi, this was illustrated well when an age-mate paid a visit to his friend; the friend could leave his house and goes to sleep elsewhere. During this time the age mate could enjoy everything in the house officially including this wife.   However, the first wife was not shared but respected.   Sometimes when the husband was not around, the age-mates could come in and share these ladies.   There was a saying in Nandi which supported the above statement: 'mabo chi korgo *eng' nandi'* meaning that a woman belonged to nobody but the community.\" Sometimes this second wife was married due to her cleanliness and was given a name as *kerotet*, meaning the \"clean one\". Many times the husband could spend more time in this house than the other houses.   During ceremonies of family rituals, the firstborn son of the first wife should be present in all occasions as he was deemed next to his father and could take over the seat of his father when the father was absent or in case he dies. He eventually becomes the chairperson or overall manager of his   parents\" estate and hence he became the father of all the other children in case the birth father died.  Each wife had her property, and no house could use wealth belonging to another house. The Nandi saying goes that: 'ma amei *go, go!'* this meant that no home ate another house. Literary this said that each house was self-contained for it to exist; it had its wealth. Each house should have its cattle boma and a farm for sorghum and millet.   The Nandi did not borrow polygyny but was part of their culture, and it had its reasons. Apart from being seen as a form of wealth and prestige, it was a way to increase family members so that in a time of raids, one family could have more members to enhance security. Sometimes when the first wife did not bear children, the husband was advised to marry another woman as children were imperative in the community. Sometimes the first wife could leave the man and go out of the family, and this could lead to marrying the second wife. The first one could be left to go for any number of years as much as she could afford, but later on, when she was old, she could come and be welcomed into the family. A married woman in Nandi was permanent, and marriage was deemed indissoluble.15 Also in case the first wife, *Jepkorek kutwo*, did not have children, she could stay up for a period when she had used all the medication but did not bear any fruit, then the second wife could now come to relight the fire of the family. After the marriage of the second wife, the first son of this second wife was given to the first woman to bring warmth to this highly respected wife. Now the first female could be seen to have children like the others community members. This second wife was a blessing to the first one in case there were no children in the first marriage.   The third and the fourth and all other subsequent wives were for prestige and also for the community in case one could afford to pay dowry and raise these families. These wives had no other reason apart from leisure, luxury, and fame; they had no proper cause.  16 On the other hand, the Nandis were few in numbers, and polygyny was a way of increasing tyranny of numbers.17 1.2.3 Extended Family The extended family was a household that expanded beyond the nuclear family, including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other relatives, who all lived nearby or in one household.   Among Nandi households, the family of an individual man includes not only his parents, siblings, and children but also all members of his similar group. A man\"s cohort was his sisters and brothers and counterpart cousins referred to as tupchet and their spouses *bamuru* while the sister\"s husband was known as sandanaa or *sandet*. Mama is a mother\"s brother\"s son and his wife while the brother\"s daughter was called *kamet* and her husband *kwan*. A woman\"s father and his brothers were referred to as *kapyugoi*, while the woman\"s mother and her sisters were *korucho*; a woman\"s father\"s sisters were called *bamuru* and wife\"s mother *abule*.  Among the Nandi, an uncle played a significant role, particularly during the initiation ceremony. The boys sought consent from their uncle before going through initiation rituals referred to as *tumdo*, in the plural.  18 The aunts together with uncles were equally crucial during special ceremonies. For example, during the engagement ceremony, the aunt played an integral role without which the occasion could not be a success minus these two relatives.   The relative is known as *senge*. This relative could even pronounce a curse if not pleased. The aunt could demand a gift before she could proclaim her blessings.19 The traditional Nandis were not interested in staying together as an extended family up to 1900. They posed more value on wealth acquisition regarding cattle than anything else. Their culture raised more importance on a cow than anything else.   No man was a man without a cow. As much as cattle acquisition was concerned, there was a need to expand the territory in search of pastures for their animals. Every man could move far away from his fellow man so as get more grass for his animals. They enjoyed a scattered lifestyle as this was a way of expanding their territory.20 This notion made them even to appreciate being squatters on European farms as long as they went there with their animals; they continued to labour for the white man even without payment.   They used polygyny as a way of expanding the community as each wife married was relocated away from her co-wife to acquire more wealth. Each homestead was",

        "sentence_chunk": "in a different location. Wealth was necessary, but the idea of staying together as a group did not exist. The Nandis did not like the idea of crowding in one place. They enjoyed scattering themselves as they believe that is a way of expanding their territory and also acquiring wealth. A saying supported this that a man could become a *manong'ot* only when he had wealth regarding livestock. *Manong'ot* was a term referring to a respected Nandi elder with his family. Power and supremacy were regarding livestock. The land was valueless unlike nowadays. They deemed that God gifted them with the land, and anyone could acquire as much land as he could, and this depended on one\"s effort.21 During this period, the year 1900, other Nilotic tribes started moving closer to their territory, and cattle theft began. They also raided the neighbouring tribes, and thus enmity brewed slowly. Hostility then prompted them to adopt this fashion of extended family. To them, the question of the extended family was borrowed from the Masaai, Luo, and Luiyha communities to enhance security.   The extended family was therefore adopted so that during raids, the whole family could guard their property in one place. Clustering led to clanism. Identification of the clan membership was simple when they lived in a single location.   The clan could not mix up with other clans.22 This notion of clanism is illustrated well on Map 1.7 Nandi Reserve of 1925 showing locations and names of military division (clans) or pororiet. For example, *Kapchepkendi* clan occupied locations 6, 4, 2, 17, and 13 respectively while *Kaptumois* clan occupied locations 9, 10, and 16 among other clans.  This joint kind of living also assisted in guarding their crops against monkeys and other wild animals like leopards, lions, tigers which could attack their livestock.23 Beer among these people brought up friends and taking part in a beer festival. When they stayed together as a community, they achieved this activity quickly. The Nandi enjoyed beer drinking as a way of bringing community members together, tabled and sorted out issues related to the community. On the other hand, living together in clan setting enhanced the population. The group\"s strength was its members. Tribalism and clanism were paramount those days.   Identifying oneself with a substantial group with much wealth was prestigious.24  ## 49212   113 1.2.4 The Clan  There were seventeen groups among the Nandi. Five of them used more than one totem. The Nandi clans lived sparsely throughout the Nandi territory. The family took its name in a patrilineal descent group from a common ancestor.   All Kalenjin had patrilineal clans, which did not pose cooperative functions apart from those governing marriage with various rules. Tracing appropriate patrilineal links occurred for only three to four generations then, from there, the same clans could intermarry or interweaved to strengthen the group or bring the family nearer. The terminology used in bringing more adjacent the relationship was called keng'wal tiliet, meaning to weave the relation and thus brought it nearer after three of four generations.25 Patrilineal clan membership and members of every group sparingly lived throughout the Nandi County. Today most of the younger generations tend to forget their groups due to cultural changes. The subject of the group has to be brought forward before the commencement of any marriage negotiations, and hence Nandi tradition followed. Intermarriage between some groups was prohibited and the question of totems aroused.26Clans among the Nandi performed some tasks including the following: i) Distribution of group land ii)Determining property boundaries iii) Regulating marriage iv) Presiding over essential functions like marriage and initiation v)Settling disputes within the group and outside the clan These clans were not localised, but their members spread throughout the district. *Koret* is their local organisation meaning their land or country. Their names and animals associated with them were as follows: 27 The animal was considered a man\"s brother, and in the case of multiple totems, they were brothers to each other and so to the clansmen. The clan members were never allowed to kill the animals unless they did some harm to its brother, and its death associated with its damage caused. A long time ago, these clans did not exist. They came into existence as a way to regulate marriage. Some clans did not marry from other clans, and so the use of animals to control who to marry or not to marry came into existence. Also, it was a way of regulating incest within the members of the same clan.28 1.2.5 Incest among the Nandi The Nandi had three categories of exogamic groups, the tribe, the age-set and the related group. Any sexual intercourse between the members of the same group was incestuous, and thus there was family incest, age-set incest, and akin incest. A man was not allowed to marry a woman from his tribe, not unless the same group possesses more than one totem and thus this union was forbidden. A woman from one\"s similar group or age-set group referred to as \"your daughter\", and thus marriage of such persons was prohibited. Marrying from one\"s age group was like marrying one\"s daughter, and this was incestuous. They viewed this incest as a serious offence and dissolved any marriage between the two relatives.29 Also, any sexual intercourse between any similar groups considered incestuous attracted some punishment. Sometimes the relationship could not be that leading to marriage, but if a man was found sleeping with his mother, sister or father with his daughter or mother in law, such incidences were serious offences. The victim could be called in the village or elders\" meeting and penalised a cow or at other times a sheep to punish. There was a specific song accompanying the punishment such that when people could hear such a song, they could know that there was somebody somewhere that had wronged the society and punishment administered.   It was a shameful act to be caught and punished in public. The elders moved the victim to the village singing a particular shaming song with the victim in front. Such person was not welcome in any beer drinking ceremony for his bad behaviour. Incest could also extend to animals; if a man was caught having a sexual relationship with an animal, the elders equally punished him like that who had intercourse with a relative.30  ## 1.3 Sexual Relationships  The Nandi had eight categories of sexual relationships namely: premarital sex, extramarital sex, rape, homosexuality, wife inheritance, woman to woman marriage, marriage into the house, and child marriage.31 1.3.1 Premarital Sex Young warriors after circumcision were free to engage in sexual activities with young uncircumcised girls in their public house. However, it was a shameful act for these heroes and their uncircumcised sweethearts in case a lover got pregnant. The child born of such illicit union was termed illegitimate and was either killed before it could take its first breath of life by its mother or taken to the cattle doorway so that the cattle could step on it till it died.   If a young uncircumcised girl got pregnant, the child was put into the mud and left to die; and if by chance one of these single girls had a child by a warrior during this intercourse, she strangled it as soon as it was born. On the other hand, the young hero who is the biological father of the kid was fined a goat to give to the girl. In many cases, such illicit children were strangled by their mother and buried, and the young warrior who is the father was commanded to present the mother of the illegitimate child with a goat and her father with another goat. Such impregnated girl attracted names like Chesorbuchot or Cheburotiot.  32 Such girl was unclean the rest of her life and lost respect in the society.33 1.3.2 Extramarital Sex A married woman in Nandi may continue enjoying a sexual relationship with her old sweetheart from the communal hut, but this was in secret. A married man may give hospitality to another man of his age set and was to abandon his house for his",

        "sentence_chunk": "visitor since there were no extra rooms as is today and allowed him to spend the night in his room. These included having sex with his wife; this was the second, the third or subsequent wives and not the first one.   The first woman was respected and never shared with age mates or any other member of the community. Apart from the above individual cases, no married woman was allowed to have extramarital sex. In case a woman was got in this act, her husband could punish her by beating or sometimes punished by divorce. This kind of offence was called *chorkonget* meaning the stolen woman.34 1.3.3 Rape Rape was considered an outrage on the female sex. Snell asserts that a warrior guilty of such offence was punished by beating by members of his age-set and denied certain privileges such as jumping and dancing during circumcision festivals. However, the age-set members punished an elder severely. The punishment was termed as Njoketab Chepyosok, meaning punishment of the women, meted out to male offenders as described by G. S. Snell.35 Oral sources revealed that such rapist commanded names like *kipyatgo*,  chelesos, and was a vice in the society. A man was fined a cow or a goat if found guilty of raping or sleeping with his mother in law. Such person brought shame to his age-set.36 1.3.4 Homosexuality From the oral sources, offences of this nature were rare.   People caught in this shameful act were beaten, and some even killed. The members of the offender\"s age set were responsible for punishment. The offender was called kipsuguit, and such person never earned respected in the society. Everyone could ridicule him whenever seen. If the offender was considered uncorrectable by beating alone, he was cursed by the elders from the neighbourhood and held up to social ridicule. They administered *Njoket* meaning punishment of the women to an offender of this category.37 1.4 Wife **Inheritance** Marriage according to Nandi customs was permanent and indissoluble even after the death of a spouse a widow will not remarry. The Nandi practised wife inheritance, calling it Kandiet meaning inheriting, or *Kindi* meaning to inherit. In the event of the death of a husband, the widow was not left to stay alone or remarry. However, the eldest brother took the responsibility.38 When a man died, his elder brother took his all wives and property, but the eldest son in inherited the arms. Wife inheritance among this community involved physical protection of the widow, her children, and property; it included the maintenance and rebuilding of her house, cultivation and fencing of her land and cattle sheds, care of her livestock and real representation in any family or neighbourhood discussion or festival. The family members were responsible for the actual naming or choosing of the person in charge of inheritance. No one could just step in without the approval of the household members.39 From the oral sources wife inheritance according to the Nandi customs did not equate to remarriage, but it was meant to only care for widows; their personal life, family or domestic, sexual and procreative needs within the context of the related group into which they got married.  40 By this belief, there was no compulsion for any widow to seek protection from her brother-in-law. They did so if the widow was wealthy and also if she had sons to inherit property. She lived independently, and eventually, her youngest son called towet who built his house assumed headship responsibility. The eldest son was named *kiboretiet*. If the deceased left more than one wife, only the younger or junior woman might be expected to cohabit with her dead husband\"s brother. The primary reason for wife inheritance among the Nandi was to procure children, care or security of the family property and the widow, family work and representation during family and neighbourhood meetings.   However, since the circumcision of the *Sawe* towards Kipkoimet up to *Kaplelach* and *Kipnyigei*, wife inheritance had been seen as overtaken by events. This practice had since been discouraged by the onset of diseases like HIV/AIDS and more STDs. Also, the current era has witnessed more women empowered with skills such that in the event of the death of a husband the wife still proceeded on well with her normal life.41 1.5 Woman to Woman Household Woman-woman household or marriage was present among the Kalenjin group, especially the Nandi, Kipsigis, and, since about the mid-twentieth century, among Keiyo. It was not customary among other Kalenjin sub-tribes. Both women and men were active in negotiating marriages and reconciling separated couples. Husbands were dominant, with the right to beat wives for certain offences. Women were publicly deferential; private relations were more nearly egalitarian. Leisure was spent with same-gender companions more than with one's spouse.   They practised woman to woman marriage for \"*lighting* the *fire'*. They did this after the wife failed to bear children and had reached menopause and could no longer receive monthly periods any longer. They performed this after the death of the husband, and if the widow was rich enough with livestock to bring up her family. At this stage, she qualified to marry another woman or women to bear her children. They believed that at this stage the woman marrying was no longer sexually active so that she could not attract another man into the house. They found that she became a man of the house and respected as a man like the other men. The children born of such marriage inherited the name of this woman in case the woman was not married, but if once married, they named the children after the old man or their father. Names like Arap Kogo were used to signify that the son belonged to a grandmother. At times the names could be associated with the bulls which the tribe celebrated so much.42 Oral sources revealed that on the marriage day, a man from the related group was identified to be responsible for the relighting of the fire. The man was to be the husband of the newly married woman to the bridegroom who was another woman. However, in case the person to relight the fire was not available on a real day, the bride was married to a bull in place of the bridegroom. They viewed this marriage like that of a man to woman marriage in nature and rituals. The woman marrying was then taken through some rituals to qualify her to assume the responsibilities of a man. The ears could be pierced to correspond to those of the old men and some unique earrings belonging to the people were put on.   Even the men\"s clothing of skin referred to as *kiboet* worn by this woman. She could also participate in the beer-drinking festival with other old men and respected like other people in beer drinking festival. She was also invited to male initiation ceremonies as a man and not as a woman. The community recognised her the same way as a man.   It was interesting to note that some of the women in this category could even be polygamist because of their elevated status in the society as people. They could marry even two or three to four wives as long as they were rich enough to pay dowry and provide for all family necessities. Sometimes a barren woman could adopt a child from a relative or bought from the neighbouring tribes like Kavirondo or Gusii to relight the fire of the family.43 Apart from igniting the fire of this family, this marriage was put in place to get an heir to inherit the land and property including the livestock. Many questions raised included; who would perpetuate the lineage? In this respect a childless couple, a childless woman widowed, or childless wife took a woman younger than her to bear children for her or the husband\"s clan. The genitor was an approved visitor by the childless woman or her husband\"s family. The genitor was either a married man or unmarried man. They fully followed the rules and regulations governing marriage as the two women went through a full wedding ceremony. According to Nandi customs, this marriage was between the two women only.44 1.6 Marriage into the house This kind of marriage is not common nowadays as it seems most Nandis at the moment",

        "sentence_chunk": "have both sons and daughters. The practice was common with the age sets of   maina, nyongi *kimnyingei* and beyond about seventy years ago. This kind of marriage was meant to ensure that the inheritance was maintained within the family lineage and in particular in to that household with daughters only. Also apart from family wealth inheritance and expansion of family members but at least to have sons in this house who were to relight the clan\"s fire. The eldest, the youngest or the most beloved daughter could remain at home while the other siblings got married outside the family. 45 Oral sources revealed that the daughter who stayed in the home got married in to the house and the marriage ritual done in this respect. They celebrated this engagement like any other engagement. This type of engagement was unique as it involved the mother of the child giving out her child and the receiving bridegroom was the king post (*toloita*) of the house. They negotiated the dowry process, and all the bride wealth belonged to the father of the daughter alone. While the dowry of the other married girls belonged to the family and more so the mother had more say about the dowry as she believed the daughters were hers, but this one married in-tothe-house, the entire dowry belonged to the husband alone.   He was privileged to use them the way he wishes without consulting anyone.46 The married daughter was allowed to raise sons in the family, and at some later stage, she could willingly or was free to get married and leave the homestead. It was because no man was allowed to live with her on the homestead; the ancestral land was family\"s property and kept within the family and the clan\"s jurisdiction. The genitor was from outside the family and was her choice. 47 1.7 Child Marriage As revealed from the oral sources, this type of marriage was not common but only practised under some strict conditions. This marriage was for socioeconomic reasons. There were cases like when a low-income family had a son ready for the wedding, and this family headed by a man could arrange for an early marriage for their young daughter with a married man who was willing to pay a dowry for his son. After this wedding, the young girl was sent to be under the custody of now the first wife till she attained the age of circumcision when she was given her house to start a family.48 Another interesting case related to the above was when in a time of hunger and famine, a poor man could give out her daughter to be married to an old man who was rich. An old man was approached to give some food to salvage the family from dying of hunger. So the old man could supply food enough for the whole family, and the young daughter was left under the custody of her parents till the age of circumcision then given to the old man and hence referred to as *kiwandererto*. It meant \"given to an old man\". They told the old man that *bae ni chu, tun keetuch makarkar inyo*. It meant that \"use this one to feed the others till such time when they will survive of tapeworms\". The marriage for such a child was not complete as the whole wedding. Under this, the marriage ended by tying a knot without performing all the other rituals. 49 1.8 **Responsibilities and Rights of Household Members** Every person performed a specific duty to ensure that the household procures an improved regular life according to their traditions. They ridiculed anyone who did not work or perform his or her role well in public. They classified traditional roles according to gender. However, because of changing trends in life, the roles were to a greater extent shared in some cases.50 Some of the traditional responsibilities of family members were as discussed below:- 1.8.1 Husbands/Men Men or husbands were expected to be role models and be responsible for providing all the basic needs of their children and wives. The caring of family property was for both men and women including children. The father was expected to love, care, listen to, guide, and advise their children on ways of participating in cultural activities. The father was responsible for everything. His name kon or *konut* signifies that he was the giver of everything. He made sure that he possessed wealth regarding cattle so as his sons used them as dowry and as a sign of a responsible man. The people were responsible for preparing initiation ceremonies for their children; organised any cultural activity like marriage, dancing, engagement, raids, community security, and beer drinking festivals. A Nandi man was seen as the leading provider holistically.51 1.8.2 Wives/Women Among the Nandi, women were confined in the home performing household chores only. They did not show much of the duties except for cleanliness of the homestead, looking after the young children, milking the cows and cutting grass for house construction. Women were expected to advise and guide girls on good morals. They also participated in cultural activities like dancing, engagements, marriage, and initiation.   However, they were expected to be passive. They waited upon their husbands to give them commands. Most of Nandi men were a bit dictatorial, and the women were, therefore, to be seen and not heard.52 Many times, women were the heads of households. The household duties were known as *'inside-the-house'* chores.   Men were never allowed to interfere with household chores.   These were referred to as women\"s department and independent of any outside interference. This type of division of women and men works was seen even during identification of children during childbirth. In case a baby girl was born in a family, the father received a notice that the child born was \"*kibo go'*, \"go' meant inside the household, this meant that the baby born was of \"inside gender\" involving a girl. Whereas when a little boy was born, he was referred to as *kibo sang'*, \"*sang'* meant outside the household. Boys were raised up knowing that they belonged to outside while girls belonged to the inside of the house.53 1.8.3 Children Children had a responsibility to help their parents in carrying out their family chores. It was their duty to respect and obey their parents and also trained to take care of the family property. Other siblings were also to be respected and cared for their younger siblings. The boys were trained to look after the sheep, goats, and calves in their tender age. They started learning how to herd cattle as they grew up and eventually, they assisted their father on other duties like hunting.  The girls, on the other hand, were trained on household chores like cleaning the house, milking the cows, fetching firewood, lighting the fire, preparing of milk gourds and decorating them with cowrie shells, beads, and animal hides.   Weeding of the family garden and harvesting of millet and sorghum also taught to children. Fetching water was a responsibility of both children up to some level then it became strictly for girls only.   They taught both children, male and female good manners and behaviour. The parents taught children how to   greet elders and also how to speak in a respected language without abusive words. They were taught to obey any other community elder even who was not related to them. Children according to the Nandi culture belonged to the community.54 1.8.4 Religion Langley (1979) asserts that for Nandi traditionalists, all of life is religious. Every aspect of the cultural framework, material and spiritual, is a tightly interwoven, direct response to the physical environment in which the people find themselves.55 Hollis argues that Nandi religion was somewhat vague and unformulated with *Asista* being the supreme deity.56 *Asista* was believed to dwell in the sky, the world, man and beast belong to him, prayers addressed to him, acknowledged as the giver of all things, and offerings made to him. The Nandi people also believed in the existence of *oiik* (dead spirits) to whom they appealed to with milk, food, and beer; this was because they may cause death and sickness if insulted.   There were structures in place to act as forms of defence against evil spirits. There were *kimonjokut* and kot ap",

        "sentence_chunk": "musambwanik (house of spirits). *Kimonjokut*: Was a stick on the apex of every Nandi hut which projected about 12 to 18 inches above the thatch. They believed that this *kimonjokut* kept the evil spirits away from entering the house through the roof. On the other hand, *kot ap musambwanik* was a hut found mostly in the *Terik* border, South West of Nandi country. This shed was erected close to the front door of the family cabin and served as a place to give offerings to the spirits. It was also a place where the evil disease spirits lodged instead of going into the family hut to cause illness  (Hollis 1905).  1.9 Relations of Production, Reproduction, and Distribution The relationships discussed are the following categories: 1.9.1 Access to Factors of Production Further, the elements subdivided into the following sections.  1.9.1.1 Land The land question in colonial Nandi was a highly skewed system of land ownership up to independence in 1963. British colonialism was accompanied by the massive and widespread alienation of arable land for the benefit of settler agriculture. As a result, the most arable land was taken from the Nandi without compensation and parcelled out to white settlers. The Nandi lost valuable land that was occupied by them for generations to the British. The land ownership system which the Nandi knew interfered. The registration of land supplemented the standard or customary land tenure system under which the Nandi had guaranteed claims over the land to individual holders under the colonial system.  The pre-colonial Nandi owned land communally. The land was plentiful and never held permanently by the community. Individual land ownership was a creation of colonialism and inherited after independence in 1963. Each clan occupied a section of land, and no other group could claim another clan\"s land. At this epoch, the land had no physical borders or something similar to fences. The trees, valleys, hills, rivers or other physical features marked area boundaries. Each clan settled in one place although the same family could occupy other locations depending on the population of the tribe. The reason behind this kind of settlement in clans was for security reasons. There were wild animals which could attack their livestock, or some other neighbouring communities could raid them.  ## 1.9.1.2 Labour  The Nandi people were semi-pastoralists, and much of their labour was in the form of herding. They planted millet, sorghum, sweet potatoes, cassava, and traditional vegetables namely: mitiat, isakyat, nderemiat, mborochet, imbokiat, bobek, isochot. The men were responsible for most of the work assisted by the women and children. It was the work of women to weave the baskets, make the milking gourds, sewing the skin garment known as *Jepkauiyet, Kiboet*. During farm cultivation, the women and men did the real land tilling, while the children could assist in herding and firewood and water fetching.   In general, women did the cultivation work and all domestic chores such as looking after children, prepare food, fetch water and firewood, wash milk gourds, clean huts and cattle *boma*, cut grass, make clothes and pottery work. While the men, on the other hand, the men herded the cattle and went to war; they also cleared the ground of the bushes and stumps, cut trees, work iron, make wooden objects, take animals to the salt lick and went to war. Both women and men milked cows, herd animals, plant, weed, and harvest crops. Other part-time specialised occupations included rainmaking, tooth-extraction, piercing earlobes, cattle-doctoring, and circumcising. Tools used in the home to facilitate various kinds of labour and professions included hoes, axes, knives, bows, arrows, shields, and spears.  1.9.2 Products of Labour Products of labour among the Nandi are discussed categorically as under: 1.9.2.1 Harvested Crops Crops harvested by the Nandi community included millet, sorghum, sweet potatoes, cassava and maize which chipped in during the colonial era. During dry seasons, their harvest was not adequate, and so they went to buy additional food from Kavirondo (Luiyha). It was known as *kesumet*.   Men were responsible for most of the farm work assisted by the children.  1.9.2.2 Milk and gourds They stored milk in gourds. There were several milk bottles. Others for storing in a partition similar to a cupboard referred to as *lengut*. Boiling milk was prohibited; however, charcoal from a particular tree known as *itet* and stored. This charcoal forms a distinctive flavour believed to be an appetiser. Milk was used either in the fresh state or left to ferment (sore milk), and some blood from cow or bull was added to fortify and make it more traditional.  Sotet (Gourd) *sotonik* (plural) obtained from pumpkins planted for that purpose known as *silagonik*. Gourds served as cups and jugs for serving milk and blood and were of assorted sizes. Each gourd had its mark to identify its owner, and the warriors\" gourds were ornamented with cowrie shells and were never allowed to drink from a new gourd. 1.9.2.3 Honey Honey was harvested late in the evening or at night.   Daytime harvesting was deemed dangerous on children and livestock. It was stored in the granary and not in the hut. There was a kind of skin bag known as *Kipsigot* used to store honey after harvesting. Honey was used together with some traditional medicine. The beehives were made of wood logs and located far away from the homestead for safety reasons.   Not everybody was able to harvest the honey. Some exceptional people perfected the art of harvesting honey.  ## 49216   113 1.9.2.4 Meat And Skins  Meat among the Nandi was used as food as well as for sacrifices. It was taken boiled or roasted. Clothing materials at the time were skins. This skin came from either domesticated or wild animal. The meat was not taken together with milk. If somebody decided to drink milk, the same person could not taste the meat. The meat was roasted and stored in a dry form known as *sirigenik*, this meat was mostly from a dead cow, or a slaughtered cow in a family and the members could not consume it within two days, the remaining were either partially boiled or stored by hanging on sticks above the fireplace. Meat from hunting was not enough to be eaten for many days and thus never stored. The animals hunted were small animals like antelopes, hares which were relatively small.  1.9.3 Access to Resources/Ownership Many informants agreed that men are entitled to control all the family resources in the home. If a woman had some income or acquired some cattle through small business, it was the husband to control such income. Some informants said that the man managed even the chicken and vegetable income if it was significant. All the control of resources originated from the man then down to wife or wives.  1.9.3.1 Livestock The nandi accumulated cattle, goats, and sheep as wealth dominated by cattle inheritance, raiding or theft, or purchase.  Anything else was not property, e.g. weapons, ornaments, and chicken. A married woman owned cattle which could not be relocated by her husband to other co-wives. Husbands and wives shared rights of owning animals seen as the most prime property of the Nandi family. The husbands or the men predominantly controlled the most significant means of production.   It was the duty of men to allocated cattle to particular houses and those not assigned to any house belong to him alone and could not jointly with his wives own them. On the other hand, the wife could also own some wealth in the form of sheep or goats were given to her during engagement of her daughters or given to her by her parents on the wedding day.   She had absolute rights over these animals, and the husband could not interfere. The children were not entitled to any property except the young warriors who could acquire their cattle through raiding.  1.9.3.2 Salt licks, Grazing and Water Points.   There were various salt lick points in different parts of the Nandi country. These salt lick points called *ng'omwo,* ng'omwet, ng'eny, ng'enda, or *sugutek* were paramount. They used salt licks for deworming cattle and",

Arara Nyukie 5. Lelmokwo 6. Barton 7. Amai 8. Kiptoros 9. Ingonyek 10. Choimim 11. Ollesos 12. Cheripo 13. Chematich Each clan had their salt lick point which was shared by the group members.  1.9.3.3 Security Tools Security or war tools were stored by men only. Women were never entitled to handle such devices. They derived these devices from particular craft people referred to as kitong'ik (blacksmiths). They produced weapons like spears, knives, swords, arrows, hoes, axes, cowbells, and arm clamps among other traditional tools. The *kitong'ik* created different tools, but the war tools included only the spears, arrows, swords and knives. Storage of these instruments was in a special place in the house near to sleeping position for easy access by men in case of an emergency. There was also a particular poison known as *ng'wonet* used together with war tools like arrows and spears to catalyse the death of an enemy. This poison could kill even if it comes into contact with a drop of blood. This poison was stored far away out of reach of children and women.  A spear, shield, a sword, and a club located with a nandi warrior were a tradition. Four different types varied in shape and sizes as follows: Ndirit: This type of spear came in two separate forms, i.e. the first had a small blade and a long shaft. It was mostly carried by the western country referred to as *Chesumei*. The second kind was different from the first one as it had a short socket and a short shaft. The spear mostly used by the eastern, southern and northern countries (*Soiin, Wareng' and Aldai*)  had a long shaft and a small blade. Ng'otit: It had a short and broad blade and used mostly by the central country people: *Emgwen*.  Erengatiat: It had a short, small leaf-shaped blade with a long socketed shank and was used by the elders.  Among the Nandi, spears were used for stabbing, not for throwing. To remember the experiences of wars, they would tie a knot of feathers belonging to a plantain eating bird on the end of their spear and never allowed to sleep with a woman.  Long'et: Is a shield from a buffalo\"s, elephant's or giant pig\"s hide fabricated to an oval shape with a narrow piece of wood that went around the edges while a broader at the centre. The centrepiece acted as a handle. The overall work was in red, white, black and grey or blue colours and finished artistically. Each country had a different mark on their shield that represented them differently.  Rotuet ap chok or *rotuet* (sword) was a long, slender and unbalanced knife. It was narrow to the hilt and broad to the tip while the sheath (*choket*) worn around the abdomen. The sword was attached to a leather belt ornamented with cowries. Rungut/*Kirungut* (club) was used to attack an advancing or retreating foe and to give an enemy a coup\" de grace. They fastened it into a leather fastening referred to as *torokeyuot* of the sword belt. Sharit/*Siarit* was a kind of a club with a long handle and was used by old men only.  Kwanget was a warriors\" bow, and *kotiek* were arrows and about twenty to thirty in one quiver known as *mootiet*. The same *mootiet* was used to carry fire stick referred as pionik and a needle called *katet* together with a spare arrowhead. 1.9.4.4 Dowry According to Nandi culture, girls engaged when they were already circumcised. They did this when aged between 14 and 18 years in groups of 5 to 8 girls.  The standard dowry according to the informants57 was four animals. The animals were never less than four or more than   eight according to the tradition. Nine animals were known to be for a dead person from the family who killed to clean the way and family fire.  1) The first one was called *Chemwai* meaning oil. It was a cow which should be under lactation (teta ne *abai)* (be accompanied by a calf.) 2) The second one was called *kimwai* should be an ox or bull  (*eito*) 3) the third one was named *kanyiyet.* It was usually a heifer  (*roriat*). 4) the fourth named teta ne bo njor, iyumi *nego,* it is usually a bull or a mature cow. (eito anan *ko iywoget*) If a bull was not available at that moment, it substituted with at least four or more sheep.  5)the fifth one was a sheep which was explicitly for mother in law. It was called *Chepng'abait*. The sheep were usually from the mother of the son to the mother of the daughter to be married.  Currently, things have changed. They paid dowry payment through money and real animals. Moreover, the number is no more extended strictly four or eight. Recently on November 27th, 2015, one suitor broke traditions when one engagement stirred Kurgung\" village in Nandi North subcounty in the former Nandi district when he spends 13 million in a meeting. This dowry negotiation was done in a modern way never seen before in the county, and it attracted politicians and intensive security personnel. Apart from this unique case, dowry has also tended to attract economic dimension. It was a time negotiated regarding money and the level to which the son and daughter have scaled in education.   Moreover, so the dowry at times is paid in an envelope. Hard cash or a banker\"s cheque is tabled instead of animals during dowry negotiations.  ## 1.10.1 Traditional Buildings And Clothing 1.10.1.1 Family House (Koot, Kapsat)  Hollis in his findings states that the Nandi did not enjoy living in villages like their neighbours, but each man lived in his hut referred to as *kaita* or a group of huts called *nganaset* which was mainly near his fields of Eleusine grain and millet.   The huts (Kapsat) were circular, and built of wattle and mud mixed with cow dung; the walls were roughly four feet in height, and the grass roofs were conical. They partitioned these huts into two rooms each, one called *koiimaut* used as a kitchen and living room cum bedroom for the man, small children, and a few goats, and the other room the occupants were the calves, sheep, and the remaining goats referred to as injoor or *injorut*. This hut had two entry doors one to *koimaut* and the other to injoor or *injorut* with a partitioned doorway joining the two sections of the house. Each wife had her hut built at a distance in another district.  Koiimaut: This was the front part of the hut which served as the principal family living room which encompasses the kitchen and sleeping areas. Above the sleeping place, approximately four feet from the floor was a loft made of strips of wood called *tabut* which was for storing drying firewood, and storage for utensils, gourds, tobacco and grain. A few inches of the loft and above the fireplace was a tray made of rope slung used for drying grain called *sainet*. There was a small compartment built out of the wall used for storing milk. The *kaplengut* housed milk gourds. Some depression in the floor (*Kilonget*) was made near the central pole (*toloita*) to accommodate beer pot. Milk bottles were hanged around the *kaplengut* while some pegs along the partition wall were used to suspend arms and also some other gourds. These wood screws were called *ireusiek*. There were two earth moulds raised on one end to serve as a pillow, which acted as a bed space for the parents separated by a mud shape in the centre and covered with an ox hide. They performed a special inaugural ceremony before erecting a house.   The elders poured milk and beer together with some salt in to the hole prepared for the reception of the central pole  (*toloita*) and prayed God to give them life and health, milk, give them power, everything which is good, give them children, millet and sorghum, cattle and to protect them. The construction work of *koot* was carried out by men up to the skeleton level so that the women would take over to finish it. The people gathered building materials, i.e. the posts and poles. A piece of a cooking pot or a wreath of grass passes over the apex of the roof, and the king post bound round with grass.   The top of the central pole (king post) was called kimonjokut. When the house was complete and",

        "sentence_chunk": "occupied, during the first four days, the occupants could not mention the name of the ground-hornbill by name (*cheptiibiit*); also the owner of the house may not sleep with his wife for this first four days. They believed that if this infringed; the house would always be draughty and cold. Also one month later, some charm was installed near the front door. This charm was made up of the tepesuet *(croton sp)* tree put in the ground in the form of a circle, and bound round with some cord of a tree called *chepnyaliliet*. This charm was to bring good luck to the family and renewed it after it caught destroyed. However, for those who had their roots in Lumbwa (Kipsigis) replaced theirs (Hollis 1905). The charm was called *mabwaita*. The thatching work was done by men while naked as if by the customary requirement. The front door was referred to as kurket ap *serem* while the back door was called kurket ap injoor.   1.10.1.2 Superstitions **of the households.** The Nandi believed in some superstitions regarding the family set up thus: One was not allowed to stand upright in a house or sit at the door or on the threshold. If a person enters a room through one door, he must not exit through the next door. Otherwise, the visiting person must pose for some time then he may now leave the side. It was mandatory for one to exit through the point of entry.   A man would not touch the threshold of his hut or any other thing other than his bed at a time when his wife was breastfeeding. Peeping into a cabin and leaving was strictly forbidden. If such happened, then the person was to cross the threshold before moving. Warriors would not exit the family hut at night, and if he wanted to do so he was to notify his mother or any other person in the shelter thus \"ilal mat\" meaning \"light the fire\". During the famine, women left for long journeys to get food for the family while the children embraced doorposts during mothers\" absence and said: \"a-asai, eiyo, ip-u *amdit*\" which meant \"I pray for the mother, bring food\". 1.10.1.3 Warriors' House (*Kai tap murenik*) This hut likens a clubhouse or a standard house where several warriors would occasionally meet to share their experiences. Women were not allowed to enter in to this kind of house. It usually had depressions (*kilongosiek)* around a central pole for the storage of beer pots as the elders would also meet in this room at times to discuss some issues of drink beer.  ## 49218   113 1.10.1.4 Warriors' Hut (Sigiroinet)  It was built a little to the rear of the family\"s cabin and was for the unmarried warriors, although the young boys would sleep there and run errands for them. Men were associated with the cold and rain; while the women related to the warmth of the family hut (Oboler 1985). The exterior of this house resembled the ordinary shed in appearance, but the interior was different as it did not house any animals like the family hut which housed goats and calves (Hollis 1905).  1.10.1.5 Warriors' Hut (*Ekoruek*) This kind of a house is likened to the slaughterhouse. It was built in the woods and was only used by warriors to slaughter oxen from time to time (Hollis 1905) 1.10.1.6 Hut for initiated boys/tarusiek (*Menjet*) They erected this kind of a house in secluded spots where young initiated boys lived near a river bank by the kids expected to be circumcised together with their patrons  (*motirenik*), and this would be their home for six months.  1.10.1.7 Granary (*Choket*) According to Nandi tradition, it was a rule to build one or two granaries near the huts. The roof was conical and thatched. These circular structures have been constructed on poles about two feet from the ground and made from wattle and daub mixed with cow dung. The granary had its superstitions thus: a *chesorbuchot* meaning a woman what had conceived before marriage was never allowed to look in to a granary as believed that her sight would spoil the grains  (Hollis 1905).  1.10.1.8 Cattle Kraal (Piut/Peut) The nandi built this cattle enclosure near the dwelling huts. A few counts of animals were kept here as a large part of the herd was often on grazing grounds in a distant venue.  1.10.1.9 Cattle Kraal at grazing points (*Kaptich*) The kraal is of thorny bushes kept in place by wood poles with two entry points such that the calves and cows had free entry points respectively. Traditionally, this kraal could host up to between 50 to 100 heads of animals at any given time.   Various families could keep their cattle in this kraal referred to as *kaptich* and were managed by warriors of such households. Girls would usually accompany these warriors  (Huntingford 1932). 1.10.1.10 Hut built in *Kaptich*/cattle kraal (*Chepkimaliot*) This kind of shed was constructed within the cattle kraal/*kaptich* and partitioned into two rooms, one for calves and the other for herdsmen with two to three warriors and girls to sleep. The roof of this house was flat and covered with cow dung, unlike the other houses whose roofs were conical in shape and thatched. The walls were about five feet high and made of wattle trees and daub mixed with cow dung.   Every morning, the girls would sweep the enclosure and throw the refuse on one side which formed a large mould with time. 1.10.1.11 Hut built in the grain fields (*Keriet*) This hut was a small thatched house with a conical roof constructed in the cornfields and used as a shelter by the people responsible for driving away the birds and monkeys.  1.10.1.12 Huts for pottery (Korik ap **terenik)** They resembled ordinary dwelling houses, but the interior design was different as it was not partitioned to accommodate the *injorut* and *koimaut* sections. Goats and people could not sleep in these huts. They prohibited the storage of utensils or grains in this hut. They never installed bed mould and goat pegs in this hut. It was designed only for those particular groups of women who did make pots. They likened this hut to a production unit or a manufacturing factory. They worked inside or outside this premise, and no other person apart from these women was allowed to either watch or go near this place while the pot making was under process.  ## 1.11 Clothing And Ornaments.  Nandi men and women dressed differently with each other. Each gender had their apparels and ornaments. Like the Maasai people, Nandi had a tribe mark which was a small hole bored in the upper part of the rear and both boys and girls fixed small pegs on or reeds in it called soliat, *solik* (plural). Young boys wore ingoriet, *ingoroik* (plural). These were garments made of goat\"s skin and sonoek/*sonaiek* (necklace made of black beads). It was a taboo for boys to wear any of the girls\" garments. The boys wore wooden earrings called *kipalpaliot* which was polished, ornamented and cut into different artistic shapes. Girls, on the other hand, wore some dresses referred to as *ingoriet* ap ko made of skin or cloth at a later stage. *Ingoriet* ap ko covered the entire body like an apron called *osiek* adorned with seeds of a Murguiyuet tree. They wore *osiek* made of leather strips and fastened onto a belt ornamented with cowries. Other embellishments included an iron chain necklaces called asing'aiit and *sirimwagik*, metal wire bracelets called makirariot, armlets called *indinyoliet*, leglets referred to as tapakwet, head armlets called *sonaiek/sonoek* and anklets known as kipkarkarek/ingibiliek. *Ketit* ap it (pieces of wood)  was used to stretch the earlobes for both boys and girls.  Warriors in the same vain wore a unique garment referred to as *kipoet* made out of up to three pieces of hides from goats or calves. They sew the garments together and loosely fixed by a strip of leather over one shoulder ornamented with white or coloured beads. They wore these garments with wired bracelets called *samoiyot*, iron wire or chains on their fingers known as *tamokyet*, an ivory arm ring and a fur skin cap called *chepkulet*.  Twins would wear a special ornament referred as samoiyot, boys, girls, and women wore this delicate ornament on their necks while the men on the other side wore it as an armlet. If a person\"s limb got injured, he",

        "sentence_chunk": "was instructed to bring a chain bracelet or leg let, and if he suffered from rheumatism, or itching in one of the ears, he put on an ostrich eggshell armlet, earring or bracelet. However, if his head ached further, he strapped a piece of wire called *sengwetiet* on his forehead.   In the Nandi community, if a sibling died, the next younger sibling would wear an ornament for the rest of his life. This ornament signified as a preventive measure against the evil spirits or diseases from attacking the next sibling in this household. Little girls wore an arrangement of beads known as *songoniet* which was attached to their hair and hangs over their foreheads and nose. Both girls and boys wore a necklace made of chips of a gourd called *sepetaiik* while at other times the boys wore a garment made of colobus monkey skin instead of goat\"s skin. In the same vain women wore a distinctive necklace called karik ap *teget* and the men an iron armlet called *asielda*. Men and females could frequently wear a claw or a piece of lion\"s or leopard\"s skin.   They wore unique ornaments as follows: Kelelik: Was worn when the arm felt painful; 1. **Sepetaik**: Worn by the boys and girls of the Talai clan and children whose younger siblings sibling had died; 2. Muit ap **sonai**: Women\"s necklace;  3. **Lapuonik**: Worn by children and calves to protect them from the evil eye; 4. Karik ap **teget**: Worn by girls who have lost their next elder brother or sister; 5. **Asingaiit**: Worn by men; 6. **Samweet**: Worn by old women.  7. Was worn when the arm felt painful.  1.12 Hair, Teeth, Tattoos, Pottery and Musical Instruments 1.12.1 Hair: Hollis (1905) in his book narrates that the Nandi people observed certain practices even with their hair which was differently treated depending on age and sex. In this case, the women and children shaved their hair once a month for old men and boys once a quarter. The boys would occasionally twist the seeds of a *murguiyuet* tree into their hair and at times a hawk or a vulture\"s feather down the back of their heads. Some women did not shave the whole head but would rather shave over the temples, ears and the back of the neck leaving the crown covered with a little hair. This practice did not extend to the young girls. They referred this practice to as piur. While on the other side, the warriors never shaved their hair but left grow long and plaited cloth or wool into the hair to give them big long tail.   For the Nandi, it was customary to shave the hair as a sign of grief; and such cut hair was thrown or hidden in the grass to the east or to where the sun rises. They shaved their eyebrows and for the beards, armpits, pubes and shins whose hair was plucked out and not shaved. In the same vein, a prisoner\"s head was cut once caught by his captor, and the hair retained until the captive ransomed. When a man adopted a child, he cut his hair and threw it to the east or where the sun rises.  1.12.2 Teeth: All the Nandi people had their two lower incisors removed as soon as the milk teeth had all been replaced by the permanent teeth. When a child removed his tooth, it was mandatory that the same be thrown away towards the direction of the rising sun and say: Asis, ee kelek che muruonen, konoo che lelach aluote *chepomoi*. The notion translates to \"God, take the brown teeth and give me a white one, so that I may drink a calf\"s milk\". This procedure of removing the lower incisors was carried out using a large needle called *katet* or an arrow used to bleed the cattle known as *long'net*. Adult teeth extracted and milk teeth of young ones had to be hidden or buried in goats\" dung.  1.12.3 Tattoos: Girls obtained these marks by cutting horizontal lines in their cheeks below the eyes or by drawing a line down the forehead and nose or by making a pattern around the eyebrows. Warriors burnt six scars on the front of their thighs, on their wrists and made cicatrices on their shoulders.   A black dye was rubbed into these marks or tattoos to make them more permanent.  ## 1.12.4 Pottery:  Nandi had some cooking pots and other kinds of containers which were the handiwork of women referred to as cheptereniot (singular) chepterenik *(plural)*. These women worked in different houses built for this purpose only. These houses resembled ordinary houses but had no partition inside like the residential houses which had the *injoor* and *koima* respectively. No man may go near this house or watch women at work. People could not sleep in such built forms nor may grain, or utensils kept in them. *Kamenon* was a pottery works area. Implements used by potters were a handle of a hoe used to pounce and stir the clay and a shoulder-bled of an ox, stone, a seed pod known as *cheptaipesiet* and some plaited *taparariet* grass, and three pieces of straw known as saatyet with which the pots were smoothed and ornamented.   After the pottery work was complete, the potters recited the following prayer: Asis! Koonech *koweit* (God! Give us strength) Ingekwang'e kikoch *piich* (Let us cook in them, that they may like them, men). The Nandi principal earthen pots, jars, and cups were as follows: Loet: Pot used for roasting malt. Kipkorotit: Cooking pot for blood.  Kipanyinyit: Cooking pot for vegetables only.  Kipungut: Cooking pot for vegetables and meat.  Kimwanit: Cooking pot for fat. Kipiitinit: Cooking pot for meat.  Kipteregit: Pot used for boiling malt (large size). Riseiyuot: Pot used for boiling malt (small size). Tapokut: Pot used to store beer.  Teret ap pei: Pot used to store water/water jar. Teret ap *kimoi*: Pot used for cooking porridge.  Target: Men\"s drinking cup.  Mwendet: Women\"s drinking cup. Tapet: Cut used for eating porridge.  1.12.5 Musical Instruments The pre-colonial Nandi people did not have any advanced music culture and thus had very few tools as stated below: Kipokandet: this was a five-stringed lyre with an extra one string which was put in place in case one of the five breaks.  Ndurerut: This was a musical pipe.  Serengwet: A horn made of wood used by young boys who blew it when taking cattle to salt licks.  Kudo Horn: This was an antelope horn use by warriors specifically for war purposes.  Ketet: This was a small wooden storage barrel for old men and was used to store old men\"s garments and sometimes employed in ceremonies as a drum.   There were no drums among the Nandi, but they referred to those of their neighbours as *sukutit*. At other times, at dances, women would accompany dances by scraping their metal bracelets against each other.  1.13.1 Birth and Naming Every child had a right to a name according to the Nandi traditions. The naming was based on seasons, time and sometimes claims of ancestral intervention through dreams by pregnant women. The boys would retain their baby names only until they reached warrior age which was after their circumcision whereas girls kept theirs only until marriage.  Girl\"s birth names were dropped at marriage and took on their father\"s names. The married girls never took their husband\"s names. On the other hand, they dropped the boy\"s birth name, and their father's name adopted. Instances would occur when a name would still refer to a man even after warrior age instead of his father\"s name; mostly it would be that the family has had a particularly illustrious ancestor. In that case, he carried his birth name to perpetuate his memory. A widow with sons would adopt names belonging to their   children, for instance, if a boy\"s name is *Kipkosgei*, the mother will refer herself as *kobot Kipkosgei* (mother of Kipkosgei). Women were never allowed to refer to their husbands by their names nor even mention them, but would refer them by the names of their sons above the name of the man would be *kwombo Kipkosgei* (father of *Kipkosgei*).  1.13.2 Circumcision Nandi practised circumcision of both boys and girls though female circumcision was fast fading as a rite of initiation due to the government of Kenya that has banned female genital mutilation and thus the ritual has lost ground among the Nandi at the moment. Boys were circumcised every four years and at the end of every fifteen years and marked an",

        "sentence_chunk": "end of one age set and the beginning of the next age-set as stated by Snell (1954). It was mandatory for the boys to put up a seclusion house known as *menjet* in the nearby forest near a stream that would be their home after circumcision ceremony. Song and dance accompanied the whole ceremony. Today the *tumndo* or male circumcision ceremony is carried out every year unlike long ago when it used to be once after four years. The initiates also take a shorter period compared to 18th and 19th century which spend more time up to six months in the seclusion hut.  1.13.3 Other Beliefs and Practices among the Nandi Other beliefs and practices among the Nandi are discussed below.  1.13.3.2 Funeral Rites According to Nandi customs, people did not bury their dead ones like it is done today except the old and children. The hyenas ate corpses thrown in the bush. Males laid on their right side and females on their left side. They buried children and the aged people under a manure heap in the cattle kraal known *as piut/peut* because children and the old ones were closer to the spirit world. When a man died, his wife/wives would remain in their house then perform ceremonial ablutions at the end of three days. The deceased\"s weapons and personal ornaments were anointed with oil, laid out for display and beer made from new millet were drunk; then one of the oxen belonging to the deceased was slaughtered for the festival. The stick forming the apex of the house (*kimonjokut*) was cut or broken off, and some of the family utensils chipped as stated by Snell (1954).  1.13.3.2 Witchcraft - (*ponisio/ponisiet*) Specific people in the Nandi society practised witchcraft and sorcery, and it had several forms thus: *bonindet*, sakutiindet, *kimetindet,* and chebusuriot. *Bonindet* could practice magic although not born with this ability. *Sakutiindet* was a barren woman believed to cause the death of a newborn baby due to jealousy. *Kimetindet* was a male member of certain clans who possessed an innate ability that could harm others. *Chebusuriot*, on the other hand, was a woman who bewitches her husband using magic as stated by Oboler  (1985). In his accounts, Snell (1954) asserts that the use of witchcraft among the Nandi was only allowed if the user had legitimate grievances and the offender for some reason could not be brought to justice as could be hiding or concealing his/her identity.  1.14 Nandi Political Divisions The Nandi country divides into districts, and each of the districts managed by two men: representative of the chief medicine man the *Orkoiyot* and one representative of the people referred to as *kiruogindet*. The country was generally under the governance of circumcision age sets called *ipinda*58 in singular and *ipinwek* in plural which circulates every seven years. *Orkoinotet* or the leadership of the Orkoiyot (leading medicine man) was a strange idea borrowed from the Maasai people whose medicine man was called *Ol-oibon*. Before the era of *Orkoiyot*, Kiruogik (plural) or Kiruogindet (singular) meaning councillors headed the Nandi country.  This new leadership of Orkoiyot or Orkoiik (plural)  coined their clan referred to as *Talai* and their leader was called *Orkoiyot*. This position was hereditary and believed that the members of this clan possessed some supernatural powers which enabled them to foretell the future and interpret omens, something which no other officers from outside this clan could do. The Orkoiyot appointed his representative referred to as *maotiot* (singular) and *maotik* (plural) in each pororiet council. The people elected their representatives called *kiruogik* who were answerable to *Orkoiyot* through maotiot. Orkoiyot and his team of *maotik* had no particular authority over *ipinda* system but due to their position as mighty men, possessed a certain degree of influence in their activities.59 1.14.1 Emet/Emotinwek Emet (singular) *emotinwek* (plural) was the most significant territorial division. *Emet* translates to land or country. Nandi country subdivides into six *emotinwek* as at the beginning of the 20th century namely60: 1. Wareng\": To the North. This word means the desolate land where grass could not burn without restrictions. The name belonged to the Nandi before settlement in this part early 19th Century. 2. Soiin: To the South and South East. This land was mainly a flat country at the foot of the escarpment (South) and hilly bordering on Tinderet forest. This name was derived from the word soi to mean grazing ground with prefix \u2013in to mean grazing ground.  3. Chesumei: To the West. This area constituted a vast forest. The name was a derivative of the word *sume* which means hairy or forest. 4. Mosop: to East.  5. Aldai: To the South-West of the country. The residents cultivated corn (*alde*) therefore the name was derived from that.  6. Emgwen: Centre of the country. The word *emgwen* is derivative of em in and kwen or *gwen* - centre.  1.14.2 Koret The basic unit comprised of 20 to 100 homesteads and referred to as *koret*. Determination of the group was by population size and virtue of topography. Each one of these units had an unusual name derived from names of animals, birds or trees. The *kokwet* was a place for the governing council responsible for the *koret*. The council of *kokwet* elders was the most important one among the Nandi. It was mandatory for all men from a *koret* to attend this assembly.   This Council held their meeting under a fig tree or any other species of fig tree found in Nandi. This place for kokwet was called *kapkiruok*, or *kapkiruoket. Kokwet* was the only legal and binding assembly for the people as there was no other tribal court for the whole community. Social ties and issues were tabled in this assembly only. There was no hereditary or elected chief to head the *kokwet*.  1.14.3 Pororiet The Nandi were divided geographically into districts or divisions called *pororiet*, pl. *pororiosiek*, and subdivisions, siritiet, pl. *siritoiik*, and geographically into clans and families, *oret*, pl. *ortinwuek*. Each clan had one or more totems or sacred animals.  Pororiet was formed out of all the *korotinwek* and their kokwet councils and thus forming a more substantial group referred to as *pororiet*. Its mandate was to handle matters affecting all *korotinwek* within its jurisdiction, which included wars, planting of crops, and circumcision. This larger Council called kapkiruoket ap *pororiet* made decisions on issues affecting *korotinwek*. Such board consisted of elders called boisiek ap kokwet, or boisiek ap kok of the *pororiet* area presided over by two representatives of the *Orkoiyot* known as *maotik*. These representatives of the *Orkoiyot* were not *orkoiik* or same as *Orkoiyot* but ordinary men elected by the members of *pororiet* from among themselves.  This council could decide to go to war on its own although they first sought blessings from *orkoiyot. Maotik* would convey this message to Orkoiyot in the company of one old man from the *pororiet* council. The council brought a pot of beer to *Orkoiyot* before they sought blessings or sanctions. If the Orkoiyot approved the request, then the leader was given magic to protect the warriors going to war.   Pororiet Council was always in touch with the Orkoiyot for its operations, unlike the kokwet which was independent in its operations.  ## 1.15 Nandi Social Divisions  The Nandi social system was divided into five thus; male group into boys, warriors, and elders; female group into girls and married women (Hollis 1905). The social groupings consisted of families, the related group often called *tiliet* meaning relative and clans. Boys aged 15 -25 years were circumcised and admitted to an age-set group called *ipinda* (age-sets) or *ipinwek* in the plural. 1.15.1 Age Sets (*Ipinwek*) The Nandi conducted circumcision ceremonies every fifteen years. Hollis states that the age set system came into place every seven and a half years but the findings from Langley (1979) and some Nandi elders differ in that it was a cycle of 15 years which means a complete cycle would take up to 105 years. All the boys",

        "sentence_chunk": "circumcised together belonged to the same age set called *ipinda* up to date although its mandate to lead the Nandi country has ceased to exist. The Nandi possess seven age sets namely: *maina, nyongi,*  kimnyingei, kaplelach, kipkoimet, sawe, *and chumo*. The age set makes a total period of one hundred and five years for a single cycle to be complete. Each *ipinda* progressed to a new age set after a handing over ceremony called saket ap *eito* (Langley 1979). The circle made it almost impossible that no age set would come into existence while the same age set was still alive. If alive then the victim should be over one hundred and five years old. Each *ipinda* had further subdivision within itself thus the eldest was called chonginiek or chongin *opir*,  the middle class was referred to as tetagat or kibal *kong*, the lower were called *kiptoinik, kiptaitoinik* meaning young bulls. A man and his son should not belong to next age sets; if a man, for example, is of *maina* age set, his eldest son should be a *sawe*.  The handing over ceremony was called saket ap *eito*. The main feature of the service was the slaughter of a white ox to mark the climax of this event. In this event marked the change-over as Oboler (1985) states that the initiates became warriors, warriors became elders while a new age set begun for boys about to be initiated. Hollis (1905) on the other hand describes the ceremony as necessary in the handing over process over the country from one *ipinda* to another. All adult male were to attend this ceremony except married warriors whose wives were not to leave their huts while the ceremony was underway. For this occasion to proceed on well, it was mandatory for the *Orkoiyot* to be present as the chief celebrant. The Warriors brought the bull.   They slaughtered a bull, and after eating the meat, the fighters would form a circle before the *Orkoiyot* who stood near a traditional stool heaped with a cow dung studded with fruits of *lapotuet* shrub (Solanum *campylanthum* sp). All the old men and the members of the age set immediately preceding the age of the one in power stood up, while the warriors to receive control of the country sat down. On the signature of the chief medicine man, all the members of the other age set took off their warrior garments and put on the old man attire. Moreover, once the ceremony adjourned, each member was required to leave for home and never sleep by the wayside under whatever circumstance.

On Indigenous Nandi kinship and marriage system, this chapter examined the family, polygynous Nandi household setup, extended family, the clan, incest, sexual relationships, premarital sex, extramarital sex, rape, and homosexuality. It showed that, having a family or marrying under Nandi context was an economic and social affair and that men did not marry for love but specific reasons.   Polygyny was prestigious among the Nandi and was practised by married men. A man could marry many wives as much as his wealth could afford. On extended family, Nandis were not interested in staying together as an extended family up to 1900 AD due to their culture of wealth acquisition regarding cattle; the community enjoyed staying scattered as a way of expanding their territory through polygyny. This community had seventeen clans dispersed throughout their territory, and five of them had more than one totem.  Internally, they had three categories of exogamic groups, the tribe, the age-set and the kindred group. Any sexual intercourse between the members of the same group was incestuous, and thus there was clan incest, age-set incest, and the kindred incest. These people had eight categories of sexual relationships namely: premarital sex, extramarital sex, rape, homosexuality, wife inheritance, woman to woman marriage, marriage into the house, and child marriage. Young warriors after circumcision were free to engage in sexual activities with young uncircumcised girls on condition that they do not impregnate their sweethearts. However, married women may continue enjoying a sexual relationship with their old lover from the communal hut but in secret. Also, a married man could give hospitality to another man of his ageset and allowed him to spend the night in his house including having sex with his wife.  Rape and homosexuality were considered a severe offence and an outrage on the female sex and was punishable by beating by the members of his age-set, and the offender was denied some privileges during communal festivals.   The Nandi practised wife inheritance in the event of the death of a husband and this could not equate to remarriage as marriage according to Nandi customs was permanent and indissoluble even after the passing of a spouse. Woman to woman marriage was also present to light the fire of the clan alongside the wedding in to the house. They believed in fire lighting which meant 'to have *children'* specially the boy child who inherited the wealth of the family. Child marriage was not typical but practised for some strict economic reasons.  Each member of the family had a role to play to ensure that the family procured an improved standard living according to their traditions. They ridiculed in public a person who violated his roles.   In total, some of the cultural beliefs as derived from the study show that; *Orkoiyot* was a later introduction in to the political system of the Nandi adopted from the Maasai in the 19th Century. Warriors defended the community and would engage in wars and raids with approval from the Orkoiyot.   They practised circumcision for both male and female among these people. The ways of life of a Nandi was centred on their cattle before and after the turn of the 19th century when they began practising the cultivation of crops such as finger millet. Their god was known as *Asis*. They also believed in the presence of *oiik* (evil spirits), and the power of lightning (*ilet*).   An analysis of Nandi built forms showed a more or less evenly settlement than being in organised villages. All Nandi people built their huts with the front doors facing Mt. Elgon or *Sabaot* which was the North of Nandi land as they believed they came through Elgon area. *Sabaot* belongs to the more significant Kalenjin group of people, and today most of them still live in Mt. Elgon area. Clan system influenced the location of one\"s homestead and sitting in the hut/*koot*. Cattle were essential to the Nandi. Therefore their animals were kept near the main hut in a circular cattle kraal/*piut/peut*. They also had a *kaptich* located in the grazing grounds away from the homestead where animals were taken care of by warriors.   Koot and *sigiroinet* had subtle implications; women associated with the warmth of the heart, while the men with the cold and rain outside. The cooking area in the *koot* was symbolic that symbolised both domestic roles of the wife and her position in the property system. They discussed marriage negotiations in the back room of the family hut referred to as injorut/injoor at the bride's home. They conducted circumcision ceremonies in the open grounds for the boys, but male initiates were circumcised and secluded in a seclusion hut called *menjet*, while the girls remained in the shelter.     1 Carol Ember and Melvin Ember, *Cultural Anthropology,*  2 nd Edition, Prentice-Hall Inc.

In African communities, marriage is not considered an individual affair that legalises the relationship between a man and a woman. However, it is a group concern because it is not only a union between husband and wife, but one between the family of the husband as well as the wife's family. Marriage in African communities is not reciprocal, i.e. a man and a woman do not marry each other.   Rather, a man marries a woman. On the other hand, marriage bride-wealth given to a woman's family is not a payment, but a gesture to establish an alliance between the two families. In a multicultural society such as South Africa these practices often create communication problems, especially where intermarriage is involved. This paper seeks to highlight competencies in interacting across cultures in a multicultural society with the emphasis on marriage practices.  ## Introduction  The concept 'marriage' is interpreted differently in societies around the world. Generally, marriage can be defined as a legal union between a man and a woman in order to live together and to have children (Allen, 1990:727). Okonkwo (2003:30) defines marriage as \"\u2026 a natural and human reality. By its nature, it is a social fact, a bond that unites man and woman, one that usually leads to a community of parents and children\". Commenting on marriage among the Jews, Baily (1959:1) says that marriage has always been held in relatively high esteem, not primarily for its rational value, but because it was a means of propagating the Holy People, of maintaining the institution of the family as the basis of the society, and for assuring a shadowy semblance of immorality to a man in the offspring which he had begotten. According to Okonkwo (2003), every culture in the world recognises some form of marriage institution and some way of classifying people socially, based on blood relationship and   ## 1  relationship through marriage. Marriage implies customs, obligations and ethical standards among a particular people or culture. African societies differ from many other world societies because they believe more in communal existence than in the autonomy of the individual. The concept of \"marriage\" in the African context suggests a relationship between two kinship groups, rather than a contract between two individuals (Brown & Thakur, 1997). Many parts of the world are becoming multicultural; this in turn leads to intermarriage.  Intermarriage here refers to marriage between members of different racial, social, cultural or religious groups. Intermarriage is becoming the predominant practice in multicultural societies such as South Africa. Since marriage practices differ from one culture to another, people engaging in intermarriage encounter communication problems which in some instances may lead to conflict. For example, some people see marriage as a contract between two individuals, whereas others see it as a communal practice. This paper seeks to highlight African marriage practices with the aim of equipping individuals with the necessary knowledge to interact across cultures.  ## Intercultural Communication  Intercultural communication is by definition a process by which communication takes place between people from two or more cultures (Wonkeryor, 1998:4). This involves the concepts necessary to understand people from other cultures and their patterns of communication. Through intercultural communication people from different cultures create shared meanings (Lustig & Koester, 1999:37). Gudykunst and Kim (1992:14) define intercultural communication as a transactional, symbolic process involving the attribution of meaning between people from different cultures. The present age is characterised by increased mobility around the world. With the introduction of modern means of transport, it has become easy for people to reach different destinations for a variety of purposes: employment, seeking better education, or simply travelling for its own sake. Piller (2003:344) writes:  Globalization is characterized by unprecedented numbers of people moving around the world; be it for the purposes of study, employment, pleasure, to flee from persecution, to name but a few. Obviously each instance of international mobility increases the chances for people to meet and find a partner from elsewhere.  A wealth of research in the last three decades has revealed that as people travel and migrate, communication becomes more \"intercultural\" and \"misunderstandings\" threaten every encounter (Hartog, 2006:175). Gudykunst and Kim (1992:3) state:  The expansion of worldwide communication networks, combined with increases in travel for pleasure or business and international migration of refugees, heightens our awareness of the need for understanding other cultures and their people.  In South Africa, multiracialism was realised with the introduction of a democratic government in 1994. People of different racial and cultural groups were free to communicate and socialise, something that was prohibited before the introduction of democracy. This is in line with Craig- Henderson (2006:49) who states:  When the interracial relationship is believed to result primarily from largescale changes in patterns of interaction between people from different racial groups, external factors are said to have played a role. When barriers to integration are eliminated, and policies ensuring interracial interaction and assimilation of minorities are implemented, relationships that were previously prohibited or circumscribed now become possible.  As a result of increased mobility and the relaxation of the policy of separate development in countries such as South Africa, cross-cultural relationships became possible. Today men and women are involved in intimate interracial relationships and marriage. Couples from different national and/or linguistic backgrounds come into existence. This type of marriage relationship is often accompanied by intercultural communication problems. As indicated above, intercultural communication is concerned with communication across cultures. People should understand the culture of other societies in order to minimise communication problems. Without adequate knowledge of other communities' cultures, one may fail to understand the meaning of certain concepts and behaviours in other languages. For instance, there are stylistic differences in marriage practices in different societies: in the African understanding, marriage is associated with the elders of the two families, i.e. the family of the man and the family of the woman, whereas in Western cultures, marriage is associated with the individuals, i.e. a man and a woman.  ## Marriage Practices In African Societies  As stated before, African societies do not consider marriage as an individual affair to legalise the relationship between a man and a woman. However, tt is a collective concern because it is not a union between husband and wife only, but a union between two families as well. An African marriage is therefore a contract between two clans and not a direct commitment between the husband and wife. According to Okonkwo (2003:31), marriage in the Igbo tradition is  \u2026 a contract between not only the two persons concerned, but also a matter of general concern for all members of the kin. All the members take it as their natural and cultural duty to find a suitable girl who is to become a member of their household. It is not just an affair between a man and a woman.  Marriage involves the whole extended family and to some African communities, the village. Both the man and the woman must obtain approval from the entire family. For example, a young man would not personally approach his prospective father-in-law and ask for the daughter's hand in marriage. The young man would instead make his intentions known to the elders in his family, and they would approach the family of the young woman. Weinrich (1983:48) argues that \u2026 [a]lthough young people today",

        "sentence_chunk": "try to choose their own spouses, their marriage remains the concern of their respective families and hardly any spouse dares to marry without their families' approval. They may exchange love tokens without informing their elders, but before finalizing their choice, they seek the consent of their families. The families' involvement in a marriage is still one of the strongest factors making for stability.  Mathu (1971:1) bases the definition of marriage on the interpretation of the Gikuyu and explains the concept as follows: Among the Gikuyu customs which constitute their traditional ways of life, marriage is understood as a way of establishing and classifying social relations. It is related to the entire social structure and is part of the relatively stable web of social relations which gives a society its distinctive integration.  Marriage is another way in which an individual shares in group life; it is the basis of the creation of interrelationship between different groups of people. Marriage is a union between two groups, which through marriage start a complex system of interrelationships bound to operate for a long time (Cutrufelli, 1983:42). This is supported by Okonkwo (2003:32) who states that in African culture, \"to marry\" means to establish continuous relations between the two families. This is so because marriage is firmly rooted in a society where the propagation of life is essentially a communal rather than just an individual concern. As stated earlier, marriage in African societies is not reciprocal, i.e. a man and a woman do not marry each other; a man marries a woman and a woman is married by the man. This means that a man takes a woman. As a result, the man is expected to offer bride-wealth for the woman. The woman in turn leaves her parents and joins the family of the man. She abandons her family name and adopts that of the husband. In contrast, in Western European societies a man and a woman get married to each other, and the families typically play a lesser role. As indicated above, in African societies the man is expected to offer bride-wealth for the woman. Bride-wealth has different names in different societies. Terms such as bride-price, marriage proceeds, dowry, etc. are used to refer to bride-wealth. In South African languages, some of the terms used to denote bride-wealth are *thundu* (Tshiven\u1e13a), *magadi* (Sotho languages) and *ilobolo* (Nguni languages). *Ilobolo* is commonly used by all South Africans to refer to bride-wealth. Simons (1968:87) writes that *ilobolo* \"\u2026 is a Zulu noun. It describes a man's obligation to give cattle, horses, hoes, money or other property to the father of his intended bride or wife in consideration of their marriage.\" In the past *ilobolo* was offered in the form of cattle, but more recently both money and cattle may be used to make this compensation. Without the offer of bride-wealth, the marriage between the individuals will not be recognised by both sides, i.e. the family of the woman and that of the man. When the man's family asks for the woman's hand from her family, and the request is accepted, the man will be asked to offer bride-wealth. However, this bride-wealth is not associated with buying something, but is regarded rather as a gesture to establish an alliance between the two families. Hence, in Tshiven\u1e13a it is called *thundu,* meaning *goods.* People who are not aware of this aspect of African culture might interpret this as a form of purchase. In this regard, Monger (2004:40) says:  The bride-price was paid in money, goods or cattle or in labour and was often seen as compensation to the kin group for the loss of the young woman to another group. To the outsider, the payment of bride-price or bride-wealth might appear to be a form of purchase.  The bride-wealth is not a commercial transaction in which a father sells his daughter to another man. This confirms that it is not payment. The father does not expect to make a profit out of his daughters. Instead, this bride-wealth is associated with a marriage agreement between family 5 groups. In African societies, the gift of bride-wealth is interpreted as a gesture of appreciation to the woman's group. It should not be misinterpreted as a purchase. Okonkwo (2003:56) states:  The habit of presenting a gift by the prospective husband to the bride's family is done throughout Africa, though in varying degrees. This marriage gift is an important institution in African societies. It is a token of gratitude from the bridegroom's people to those of the bride, for their care over her and for allowing her to become his wife. \u2026 This surely is not a form of 'payment' as outsiders have so often mistakenly said.  As stated earlier, without the gift of bride-wealth no relations will be recognised by either family.   Kyewalyanga (1978:51) supports the above assertion:  It is the payment of the bride-price which makes marriage valid in most African cultures. The bride-price seals the marriage contract. It acts as a guarantee of the stability of the marriage. The bride-price is compensation to the girl's parents for the loss of a daughter who has been an assisting person in the family. It must be emphasized that though the bride-price seems to imply the buying of a wife, it is neither a buying nor is it intended to mean this. A wife, after the payment of the bride-price, does not become a husband's property.  The husband's power in relation to his wife is not that which buyers acquire over the goods they buy. According to Simons (1968:88), the husband \u2026 does not 'own' his wife in any sense. He cannot destroy her, sell her or lease her to another person. He cannot 'repudiate' the marriage and recover the lobolo because of her 'latent defects'. He is legally obliged to maintain her and fulfill the other duties that a husband owes to his wife. He is liable to lose her and forfeit his claim to a return of lobolo if he ill-treats or neglects her.  The bride-wealth does not have an exchange value. Another important function of bride-wealth is to sanction the control of the groom's family over the couple's offspring. Thus, children born to the woman will be recognised as legitimate offspring. The relative importance of children, in turn, influences bride-wealth gifts because bride-wealth is mainly offered to legalise the affiliation of children (Weinrich, 1983:38). When bride-wealth is given, children born out of such a marriage belong to the husband; but if not paid, children are not recognised as his. For example, when a man separates from his wife without having paid the bride-wealth in African societies, the elders will rule that the wife be given custody of the offspring. The children belong to the family of the wife in this regard. However, if the bride-wealth has been paid for the woman, custody of the offspring will be given to the husband and his family. Mathu (1971:2) states: \"The right of ownership and control over the socialization of the offspring on the part of the husband is established by means of 'bride-token'  (*ruracio*), which is given to the bride's kinsmen by the groom himself, or the groom's father or his kinsmen\". Cutrufeli (1983:49) supports the above: Marriage goods are not for exchange; actually, by being moved one way or another, they sanction the control of one side over the offspring of a woman from the other side. It is not a matter of exchanging women for dowry items: what is the issue in this circulating process is the offspring anticipated from a woman. It would probably be more accurate to say that dowries circulate not contrariwise to women but to children. Truly, it can be observed that in case of divorce often the dowry is not rendered if the children stay with their father.  The right of ownership of the offspring is practiced differently in other cultural groups. The offspring belong to both husband and wife because the offering of bride-wealth is not recognised.  ## Conclusion  Knowledge of African culture regarding marriage practices is of utmost importance to those who wish to involve themselves in intermarriage with Africans. This will minimise any misunderstandings, such as who should be major players",

Marriage in African societies means something different to other cultures in the sense that it is communal rather than individualistic. A woman is married to the family of the man, whereas the man becomes the son-in-law to the family of the woman. The value of the involvement of the two families in the marriage is sometimes realised when there is a conflict in the family. The two families will assist in resolving problems between the woman and the man. In many instances, the two families will try to reconcile the two individuals. Under no circumstances will they encourage divorce. According to Nwosu (1999), divorce is not common where this practice is still followed. Marriage is therefore conducted to form strong relationships between two kinship groups. The payment of the bride-wealth is highly regarded in African societies because it legalises the marriage. The bride-wealth paid by the man is not meant to buy the woman, but is a token of appreciation to the parents of the woman, and legalises the affiliation of the offspring. Without bride-wealth there is no marriage in African societies.  ## References  Allen, R.E. (ed.). 1990. *The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English.* Oxford: Clarendon Press.

She grew up and received her early education in Kajiado District. She read Education, Literature and Linguistics at the University of Nairobi, from which she graduated in 1975.   She has a keen interest in the Maasai traditional practices and has collected a substantial amount of oral data of historical and anthropological importance. Miss Kipury is presently working for the Kenya National Archives.   In most African communities, marriage, as a social contract, is not a one person's affair. It requires the decision, the consent and the blessing of everyone-ranging from the parents, the clan-members and at times members of a whole section. It is also a duty for everyone to marry and although there are a few accepted exceptions as regards women, it is considered a great misfortune and a curse for a man to stay as a bachelor. But, it is popularly believed among the Maasai (I have no statistical evidence to confirm it) that out of every age-set there are seven people whose fate it is to grow old and die unmarried.   Although the society ridicules and looks down upon them, they are also an object of sympathy especially since they spend many years trying to obtain brides but to no avail. But since they have failed to conform to the required norms of the corporate society, no one is obligated to give them respect accorded to elders. They do not fit into any ritual organization that forms the core of Maasai society.   It is different with women. There are cases where a father decides to retain one of his daughters at home if he has no sons so she A Maasai girl, old enough to be circumcised.   38 may beget him sons with a man or men of her choice to be his heirs .. This is because a woman is not entitled to inherit her father's property.   There are rules, regulations and also taboos governing marriage. These determine the clan and the age of the couple who marry or may not marry. Close relatives are not to marry in Maasai culture; the clans are exogamous, that is, one may not marry a person of his/her clan. To do so a man has to give away a heifer to the father of the bride.   This is intended to wipe away the \"blood\" relation that might have existed between the two. However, this fine is only possible if the two are members of the same clan.   But clans are subdivided and members of the same sub-clan can under no circumstance marry.   Men of one's father's age-set are also\u00b7  regarded as one's \"father\", hence no marriage is feasible between them and the younger person. In general everyone knows who is a relative and who is not. When complete strangers meet for the first time they first find-out all the details of each other's kinship.   Hence, before a man thinks of making an approach for marriage, all the details of the kinship should have been cleared beforehand.   ## Betrothal Procedure  The method of betrothal is more or less the same for all the sections.   The usual practice is that a given family decides to obtain a bride (from a particular family). Having spotted the girl, the mother of the man who wants to marry and another woman of her clan set off to the girl's home.   They carry with them either one of three items-a chainl , some butter or cow dung.   These women may be dressed either casually or ceremonially. On reaching the home, they seek out the girl and pretend to fix he.r ornaments for her and in the case of bringing a chain they slip it on her neck. Otherwise, they smear some butter or cow dung on her abdomen. This act is referred to as Esirata2 and it signifies the picking out of the girl from among many. The marking is usually accom-pa~ied by the sentence. \"Talepo inDo . ....... .   \"May you milk those of ........\u2022. \" whatever clan the speaker belongs to. If the \"marked\" girl: is old enough to realise the meaning of the' act she will throw the chain away and wipe off the dung or butter. and some do cry very bitterly. It is then up to the visitors to 1. A long chain attached to other ornments is usually worn by women. A piece of this could be used.   2. The making of a mark.   recover the Esiret (marriage token) and take it to the girl's mother to keep. In most cases the girl is too young to realise' the significance of the whole exercise and may excitedly go around showing off the beautiful ornament given her by the visitor, in the case of the chain.   In cases where there are no daughters who are not \"booked\", the marking would be done on the stomach of a pregnant woman in hope that she'd bear a daughter.   If she had a son, a close friendship would be established between the new-born and the would-have-been husband. The two would in most cases exchange cows and call each other Pakiteng3\u2022 This is the normal accepted betrothal procedure but there is a very small percentage of people who do not abide by societal rules. I will briefly mention the lot of this minority.   A man may fall in love with a girl and decide to put her in the family way. It is taboo for an uncircumcised girl to get pregnant, hence many people shun marrying such a girl.   With families who take the \"crime\" most seriously the girl is disowned as an outcast.   She is taken to the bush at dusk and tied onto a tree with a bull and left to be eaten by wild animals. Whoever may want to claim the girl may take her as an adopted person and her name would never again be associated with her original family. The minority of these men who decide to obtain brides in such fashion are the ones who stand very narrow chances of obtaining brides of their choice through the normal procedures.   But even so, it is not always a guarantee that they will marry the girl. Some families who are more lenient in their view toward pregnancy before circumcision may decide to stop the man from marrying the girl, and instead look for another suitor for the girl. Others may decide to fine the man a numb~r of cows before they allow him to marry their daughter. In general Entaapai4 is despised and she remains an object of scorn throughout her life.   There are some cases where a circumcised girl would elope with a man she loves.   She may either be brought back and married to someone else or she may be allowed to stay on while the marriage formalities are conducted in the usual way. When a woman refuses to marry the person chosen for her.   she is often beaten by her brothers and clan members in an attempt to force her into 3. The one with whom we exchanged cows-the giving could either be reciprocal or one-sided.   4. A girl who gets pregnant before circumcision.   marriage. Some women comply after the   ![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)  beating but others remain obstinate. There was a case of a woman who would only marry an ugly man chosen for her if her eyes were plucked out to prevent her from seeing his ugly face. Her father prevented her from being whipped and instead allowed her to marry a \"handsome\" man of her choice.   Individual cases exist and they are treated differently, other than by following a set of rules and regulations. It is also important to note that it is a great dishonour to the father for his daughter to refuse to marry a man he chose for her. The girl is considered disesrpectful to her father if she turns down his proposal of a suitor.   Once the betrothal \"mark\" has been made it is followed soon after by the arrival of the groom's parents to declare their intention formally. The boy's mother and her lady escort set off to the bride's home dressed in ceremonial cloaks. With them they carry honey and milk. This honey is refered to as Esiret enkoshoke (the mark of the stomach) on account of its close association with the act of \"marking\" the girl's stomach just a little earlier. The women also hold bamboo staffs IIartati 5 and apply a lot of fat on their bodies. The mouth of the calabash containing the honey is sewn with sisal and Enkoti (a small gourd) used as 5.

I n cases where honey is not available in large amounts, sugar is put in the calabash and a little honey added.   The honey is eaten by all the women of that village and it is a way of alerting them that one of their daughters is being sought for marriage. If the marriage does not go through successfully, this honey is the one item that is never refunded to the groom's family.   When this is completed the Enkiroret 6 is brought in the same ceremonial style by the same women. The marriage proposal will be brought up for discussion and the man  (usually his father and clan members) is informed whether his request is favourable or not. The latest honey is brewed to be drunk during the discussion. The girl is initiated around the ages of between 13-18 years. If the talks are promising the spouse takes some tobacco for the women, some sheets for the close relatives of the bride, and a blanket for his father-in-law. Some may also carry some more sugar for brewing beer. The tobacco is spread on a hide the 6.. The beer that opens up talks.   next day for all the women to take and chew. A  day is then set for the bride 'to be married off.. . In normal circumstances the groom IS  expected to bring fiVe items as presents once he is promised the bride. A heifer (enkiteng)  goes to his father-in-law to enable them to call each other Pakiteng. An ewe (enker)  that goes to his mother-in-law necessitates the name Paker', since in-laws are not permitted to 'call each other by name. He also brings a bullock and a cow with a calf.   The last three are not designated to any particular person but I would think they are symbolic of a state of procreation. Since to the Maasai procreation is the idea behind marriage, a man and a woman are expected to come together in order to bring forth children. A bull, and cow with a calf could be a polite way of announcing societal expectations to the new couple. The animals that are given should all be of the same colour.   The heifer and the ewe are brought before marriage takes place but the rest can be brought later on. '  When all the wedding deliberations have been completed it remains for the bride to be \"led away\" in ceremony.   ## The Wedding Ceremony  There are two ways in which the wedding is conducted. There is a casual kind of wedding, Errotianarrot08 which is simple with little emphasis on the ceremonial procedures. Then there is a formal wedding Erikoroto too nkishu9 where all the rules and regulations pertaining to marriage are strictly adhered to. A woman may be married casually but unless she goes through the procedure of formalising her marriage she is not entitled to perform any ritual, like circumcision, on her children. I will relate the procedure followed in the formal wedding since it is the more important of the two.   Three days before the scheduled day for the wedding the bridegroom arrives with three other people; a woman, a little girl and his best-man. He also brings with him twd fat rams and honey for brewing beer to be : drunk while the final deliberations are going on. Besides their daily attire the two men wear black beads on their necks. They mu~t also put on ceremonial cloaks and ~arry staffs The woman is also dressed ceremOnially, but the little girl is only smartly dressed since she is not entitled to a ceremonial cloak or staff. However, they all apply a lot of fat on their bodies.   On arrival at the bride's home, the animals are put into an enclosure inside the village and after a while they are driven out into the fields for grazing. Then they are brought back with the rest of the cows to the village. The next morning one of the two rams is slaugptared; it is referred to as O/barnet'O because it is on that evening that the bride's hair is shaven off. That same evening the wedding ram Orikoret 11 is slaughtered. The meat of both rams has to be eaten and finished the same day.   Some fat from the second ram is stored in a container (0/ku/et)12 for the bride to carry to her new home. All the fathers of the girl who include clan members, uncles and men of her father's age-set get together with the bride and groom. They advise them on the possible penalties for their conduct and to honour their marriage. This takes place while the beer is being drunk. They are then both blessed and left to retire for the night.   Early in the morning on the wedding day, the bride is dressed up by the women in readiness to leave her home. Among the ornaments she wears are four leather rings, IIkerretil3, two made from the' two rams that were brought by the groom and the other two from rams slaughtered for her before circumcision. These rings are put on her fingers. On her back she carries one calabash of fresh milk and another of fresh milk mixed with blood, a mixture known as /nkipot. Among her ornaments are four wooden dolls, three representing girls and one representing a boy.   These are hung suspended on a string on her neck. The girl dolls have their legs covered with wire up to the knees\u00b7 and also on their necks, while the boy doll has the wire only on one leg. This wire was brought by the groom.   The dolls are carved out of very hard wood of a tree called O/timigomi and it is renowned for its durability----obviously to wish the bride a long, healthy life with children. She also wears a string of black (dark blue) beads  (Enkononkoi) which her younger sister slips on her neck as she comes out of the house.   /surutia 14 (wire-coils) are another kind of ornament the bride has to have. On her waist she ties two belts of thin leather and her leather shoes are put on her feet so that the 10. The one for the shaving.   11.

Two round copper or iron coils worn mainly by women but also worn by men in cenain rituals.   Girls of this age are usually booked for marriage.   ![4_image_0.png](4_image_0.png)  ![4_image_1.png](4_image_1.png)  A group of young men warming themselves by a fire. One of them has on a calfskin worn by men in many rituals, including wedding ceremonies.   left shoe goes to the right foot and vice versa.   The bride weeps bitterly mainly because she is obviously sad to leave her home and relatives, but also particularly because she is expected to weep-otherwise she would be laughed at and teased that she loves to get married.   When the bride and the procession are ready to leave, the bride is taken to the main gate of the home (kishomi) 15 for the final blessing. Two elders, one holding a calabash of milk and the other of honey beer, confer the blessing. Each of these gourds is covered with green grass, signifying fertility. The grass is dipped into the liquids and sprinkled on the bride's face, feet and body.   This act is performed simultaneously with utterances of blessings such as:- Taa paming'ori May you be popular Tanapa olgilata May you take care of your linyi clan.   Tanapa minyi 0 May you look after your ng'utunyi mother and father.   15. Gate for a kraal ; each family has its own gate.   Mikitalala oriong' May your back grow wide.   Mikinosa olgilata Mayall your clan and your linyi pooki section feed on you.   olosho linyi . .. (aanyayie endaa)  (literal translation)  Green grass is stuck on her waist and on her shoes. The bride then leaves for her new home with four \"strangers.\" She receives no escort from her people and her mother is not even supposed to see her leave. She should be in doors. Once she starts off on her wedding journey the bride is not supposed to look back.   The rest of the procession goes before the bride who customarily has to walk very slowly in case she appears anxious to take and be taken by the new husband. The duty of the best-man is to \"sweep the way\" for the bride who is not to jump over the smallest plant along the path. The best-man has to car~y her across a river or a gulley and over any big obstacle on the way. Being good",

Box 43844-00100, Nairobi, Kenya  ## Abstract  It is the 'opinion consensuses of a few scholars that the institution of marriage has continued to dwindle because of a lot of social economic and cultural factors. With the passing of time, certain ills have befallen marriage that it has dealt a devastating blow to society. This has produced along it trails a myriad of social problems as a result; single parenthood, divorce, separations, rape, homosexuality, lesbianism and prostitution, the list continues. These cases are rapidly on the increase. This reflection will adopt a social cultural analysis of the problem as it is viewed today, especially regarding various scholars who have contributed to this issue and have tried to tackle it in various aspects. It hopes to be critical not just analytic of some to the options and opinions adopted. The reflection also seeks to interpret within the context of the African traditional marriage and sexuality, the values attached especially to marriage. The objective of the reflection is to establish that though marriage suffers handicaps in the society, there exists within the African traditional marriage system resources available, which if discerned and learned properly can help checkmate or even stalemate some of the ills it suffers today. The underline contribution is that there is value especially in the traditional marriage system this value is underscored in life. Marriage was geared towards the procreation and promotion of life. Seen within this context, there exist the 'kernel' essential properties that held traditional marriage systems, even though there existed also the 'husk' material elements that fade with the passage of time in marriage. Underlining all this was the life of the community. The reflections assumes and expect that at the end of the day reverting to the basic essential value of marriage will go a long way in the prevention of some of these ills that are associated with marriage. It expects that society including Christianity will be able to learn from the traditional system, that indeed not for nostalgic reasons, the core of marriage is to be preserved in life.  Vol. 1 , No. 2, 2012, E-ISSN: 2226-6348 \u00a9 2012 **HRMARS**  ## Introduction  The institution of marriage is faced with many daunting challenges. As people made up of cultures and traditions and with the influx of Christianity and civilizations that have continued to change the lives of so many people, how is it that still we can't overcome the problems that are associated with marriages in contemporary times. The challenges seemed enormous and daunting but it will be wrong to give in completely. What seemed right is if we could resort to certain resources that are available to us and to see whether we can address marriage issues and sexuality in or society. We would investigate why marriage has undergone such intense hardships and burdens to the extent that people no longer fill comfortable discussing positively about marriages and marrying in general. Furthermore, a lot of illicit unions are on the increase, to what extent this will continue and how it can be dealt with in the society and the church is still any ones guess. The interest of this reflection is to try and present the reality of marriage and sexuality as it understood today, highlighting the various strands that continue to rock the institutions of marriage. Basically we would try to separate the proverbial 'Kernel from the Husk'. 'The Kernel' for me has to do with the properties of marriage and its unique validity. While 'The Husk' will mean the externals that sometimes clot the actual essentials of marriages, and tends to gain considerable weight on marriages, and appears to be the first victims to disappear after the ceremonies of marriage are over. It is my contention that traditional marriage system offers us values that will help reposition our outlook on marriage and sexuality today. The thrust of the work will be to try and understand marriage and sexuality in the African context, but more so to see if there are lesson that can be learned and can present a way out for an already embattled institution with breakages, single parenthood and many more issues on the increase.  ## The Question Of Marriage Today  A more healthy understanding of marriage today can be appreciated if we carefully consider what I have referred to as 'the kernel' of marriage, which are the properties of marriage and what makes it valid. To my mind African marriages are not short of such ingredients that constitute marriages. Hendrix in a discussion of African marriage systems opines that marriages as we know it, is multifaceted and its definitions reflect this in their diversity. Several normative behavior patterns are counted among its traits in most societies, while ceremonies or transactions commonly mark its inception. In most societies there is an expectation of relative permanence, co residence, a division of labor, sharing of resources, a sexual relationship, procreation and cooperation in child bearing and training (Hendrix, 1996: 173). Ayisi (1997) collaborates this in his work when he also observed that the means by which a man and woman come together to form a union for the purpose of procreation is marriage. He stressed further that African marriages are affected for just this purpose and therefore a childless marriage ceases to be meaningful in this context. For every marriage to be legal, certain requirements have to be fulfilled, and it should be preceded by certain customary observances (Ayisi, 1997:7).  # Vol. 1 , No. 2, 2012, E-Issn: 2226-6348 \u00a9 2012 Hrmars  However, Megasa adds that \"the communities involved share their very existence in that reality and they become one people, one thing, as African themselves would put it that through their marriage, their families and clans are also united so that what is done to one of their members is done to all. By this gesture marriage also means that the partners' responsibilities are not limited to them alone but have a much wider application. Their own personal identity and identification are equally extended (Magesa, 1998:110). A further understanding of marriages amongst Africans suggests that there are at least three defining aspects of these marriages; first marriage is a transfer of legal rights to a woman from her kin to",

        "sentence_chunk": "her husband. Not only does the husband gain rights to the wife's labor, sexuality and offspring's, but also the rights to receive compensation for the harm done to her by others. In some societies the husband receives rights to offspring if he pays the full bride price but can receive more limited rights if he makes a small payment. Second marriage modifies and to some degree ruptures, the relations between the bride and her immediate kin. In many societies the wife moves out of her parents' home and they lose a family member. Where the husband joins the wife's parent's household there is less disruption. Third marriage is an affiance, an agreement or contract between two families or groups of kin's, because our African societies see marriage not only as a relationship between two individuals people but also as a structural link between groups (Hendrix, 1998:734). As a result of the absolute connectedness of African marriages to the community which is not in any way an affair between the individual and the marrying parties alone, it is essential to highlight some values that are rooted in these marriages in our societies, their identification will benefit us in abetting the continuous wreckages that marriages suffer especially these modern times. The reason is to preserve all about 'the kernel' as highlighted in marriage and to expose its value in traditional marriage systems, furthermore an understanding of the values we are seeking for in marriage must be clearly identified, exposed and expounded on.  ## Traditional Values Associated With African Marriages  When we talk of values we refer to interest, pleasure, likes, preference, duties, moral, obligations, desires, wants, needs, aversions and attractions and many other modalities of selective orientation (William, 1968:283). However the limits of value maybe conceived very broadly or quite narrowly, but the limits should never be arbitrarily set and their location ought to be justified in any particular case. A broad comprehensive conception of values has the advantage of calling attention to possible value elements in all behavior save the most rigidly instinctive or automatic. While a narrow definition may have the virtues of specificity and definiteness but may lead to errors if the excluded phenomena are not taken into account through concepts closely related to the idea of value (William, 1968:283) In such an expanse of allowance therefore we would like to identify some values in the traditional African nature of marriage and see whether they can be of help in strengthening the lapses that   Vol. 1 , No. 2, 2012, E-ISSN: 2226-6348 \u00a9 2012 **HRMARS** are noticeable in marriages today. What is clear, before us is that we find the essentials of marriage in all cultures, namely a lifelong union of husband and wife for mutual support and progeny to continue the ancestral line and to promote the welfare of the tribe or clan (Moler, 1982:3).  That is why anything that deliberately goes towards the destruction or obstruction of human life is regarded as wicked and evil. Therefore anybody who under normal conditions refuses to get married is committing a major offense in the eyes of the society and people will be against him. In all African societies everything possible is done to prepare people for marriage and to make them think in terms of marriage (Mbiti, 1969:104). In some parts of Africa pare choose marriage partners for their children even before they are born. This is to make it absolutely sure that they do get someone to marry. Other parts the choice is made for the young people by their relatives, while another custom is to let the young people themselves find the person they wish to marry and then inform their parents or other relatives. The opportunities for them to do this are provided by social gatherings, dance and communal work and by their knowing other people in the neighborhood (Mbiti, 1969:107). The obligation to get married is therefore the only means of human survival as far as the views of African peoples are concerned. For that reason it is a religious obligation. It is as old as human society, through marriage and childbearing, human is preserved, propagated and perpetuated. Through them life is also deepened vertically and spread horizontally. Therefore marriage and childbearing are the focus of life they are at the very center of human existence, just as man is at the very center of the universe (Mbiti, 1969:106) \"The abundance of life is the reason behind all forms of marriage and unions and this is why African religion sanctions many variations of unions. Even when these forms are situated within certain social economic context that is social prestige or the assurance of hands to work the fields (which motivations are always present, given the unity of life) they all serve to preserve and prolong life, to provide for ritual fecundity and physical procreation (Magesa, 1998:128). Another attracting value, which is upheld most in African marriages, is creatively, depicted in kgatla proverb 'a pretty girl either steals or wets her bed'. They mean by this that physical beauty alone is not the most important thing to look for in a wife. Industry in physical work, a respectful demeanor towards elders and a generally good reputation as defined by the ethnic group are the most significant characteristic for both partners. These characteristics are assessed by the qualities of the parent themselves. Wealth on the part of the boy's parent is of course a factor in his favor but that is less important than personal character.\"(Magesa, 1998:114). However with easy access to resources, families would not be expected to try to limit the number of children. Daughters did not share in the property of their father and were not differentially endowed at marriage. In fact they attracted the bride wealth necessary for the marriages of their brothers. Girls were as important as boys and there is no evidence of any fertility 'stopping rule' or indeed of any tendency to prefer children of one sex (Goody, 1997:457).  Vol. 1 , No. 2, 2012, E-ISSN: 2226-6348 \u00a9 2012 **HRMARS** Similarly, an aspect that is equally of significant value and rears it5 head continually in African marriages is the communal value of marriage. In marriage the family is the person's channel of integration into the clan and the wider society. Consequently, in marrying his wife. . .the man accepted the responsibilities towards another family and she likewise, this social and communitarian character of African marriage means that the two communities are bound so closely together through a marriage that certain condition such as a rift between the two communities can actually nullify a marriage between two person. Enmity between the clans notwithstanding any amount of cordiality and love between the two individual can not only nullify a marriage but also make it impossible in the first place. The value of marriage is communal and the couple's consent has validity only in this communal social context (Magesa, 1998:113). It could be argued that in this context today such marriage has no relevance because it pry on peoples individuality but it should be remembered that the sacredness of the value attached to this union and the commitment which is made to one another deserves that the institution is protected and connected to the community. Marriage is not just an individual or the couple concerned business as noticed today it concerns all and is affected by all. For instance the traditional system in Africa required a high degree of cooperation between members of the same household (family) and lineage (or other wider grouping of kin or community) given the absence of specialized services and of centralized welfare institutions, there was considerable dependence upon kith and kin, orphan hood, widowhood and divorce, while always personal tragedies (despite the assumptions of some European family historians and demographers) were not faced alone, even if there were in general few sources of welfare other than kin (Goody, 1997:458). As a value of marriage this bilateral orientations and kinship affiliations are really",

        "sentence_chunk": "essentials in seeing to the sustenance of the African marriage. Even among the matrilineal and matrilocal peoples, as for example among the Akan speaking Ashanti of Ivory coast and Ghana, or bakwaya of Tanzania, bilateral orientations remain a strong feature. In the study among the Ashanti, Meyer Fortes found that the basis of all social relationship is the bond between the mother and her child, between the father and the child exist only a bond of love as a father has no legal rights whatsoever over his children. Instead this is the prerogative of the mother's brother. Thus the Ashanti say your mother is your family, your father is not. Yet he is recognized as playing an indispensable role even in the kinship structure. Generally, he names his children after his own ancestors in an important religious function as noted above. Furthermore, by the very fact of his paternity he is recognized to bequeath his personality or spirit to his children without whom they cannot thrive or succeed in life. He takes pride in bringing up his children and in supervising their moral and civic training (Goody, 1997:458). All these ensured that the survival of the marriage and the kinship structure in Africa depended on marriage. Without going into great details about these kinship and clan structures, it is important to say something about the relationship between marriage and kinship. What establishes clan relationship to begin with is consanguinity, which is considered to be primary and most important relationship in the social structure. It is recognized, however that   Vol. 1 , No. 2, 2012, E-ISSN: 2226-6348 \u00a9 2012 **HRMARS** consanguine relationship (affected through birth) are not possible without a final relationship, that is relationship affected through marriage. In the long run, marriage always establishes very strong bonds between the individual belonging to different families and clans particularly when children are born (Magesa, 1998:112).  The truth is marriage in the African sense conferred status and dignity, Ayisis asserts that it conferred certain rights on the wife and corresponding duties on the husband and vice versa. The various rights that a man acquires after he has performed all the necessary customs (presentations) are divided into two classes. They are firstly, rights in *uxorem*, meaning rights in genetricism, which are the rights of a woman as a mother. This means that the man has to feed and protect the wife and children (Ayisi, 1997:8 - 9). These rights although they seemed obvious are supposed to be taken seriously for failure to perform this sacred function could lead to a lost of the marriage and leads eventually to family breakup and shame. This responsibility becomes grave in the sense that there are no complete breakups in our African marriages. As an institution divorce is widespread in Africa though it appears to have been less common among some patrilineal groups that incorporate wives into the husband linage However it is not cleat that this term provides description, since wives (apart from slaves) always retain some ties with their natal families and lineages, which remains important for the children. These are the ties that Fortes refer to as complementary afilation (Goody, 1997:459). Indeed from what we have underscored, we could safely conclude there is within the African marital systems the adequate properties of value to justify a proper marriage that will not only be fruitful but long lasting. But there is more to marriage apart from its rights and duties, fidelity and sexuality carries with it a whole gamut of responsibilities and expectations.  ## The Understanding Of Sexuality In The Context Of The African Marriage  We have tried to emphasize the sanctity of marriage as experienced in the traditional setting. But in marriage the place of sexuality is paramount because it is geared towards procreation, however \"in African societies sex is not used for biological purposes alone. It has also religious and social uses. For procreation and pleasure, sex plays an important and obvious role in any normal marriage and in any society of the world. There are African people among whom rituals are solemnly opened or concluded with actual or symbolic sexual intercourse between husband and wife or other officiating persons. This is like a solemn seal or signature in which sex is used in and as a sacred action, as a 'sacrament' signifying inward spiritual values\"(Mbiti, 1959:146). This suggests that the purpose for sex and its use are clearly stated in African society and it is expected that sex will be limited to this arena. To ensure the sustenance of this 'deified arena' taboo are sounded and expressed out allowed. It does not give room to the situation we are faced with today where sexual licentiousness is promoted and adorned with pride. Infect sexual organs are considered pathway to lie in traditional societies. Mbiti strengthens this fact that sexual organs are the gates of life, for many African people the genitals and buttocks are the parts of the body must carefully covered; their lack of covering constitutes 'nakedness' in the eyes of   Vol. 1 , No. 2, 2012, E-ISSN: 2226-6348 \u00a9 2012 **HRMARS** traditional Africans (Mbiti, 1969:146). A phenomenon that is worth preserving today considering the influx of media appeals to the discomfort of seeing our women and young girls almost go naked in the name of new wave fashion. Moreover, there was the procreative emphasis of sex in marriage itself which the social structures of traditional society, especially the family, community adequate made provision for. So, sexual deviation was indeed a threat to these structures. It became apparent that youth be trained for reproductive life in conformity to the structure through social initiation rites. Sexual morality was safeguarded by the structures of society, more than by individual personal responsibility. Sexual activity was the subject of much ritual symbolism. It was frequently dramatized in dances and arts, and was surrounded by many taboos, a typical example which was avoidance (Shorter, 1999:94). Fornication, incest rape, seduction, homosexual relations, sleeping with a forbidden 'relative' or domestic animals, intimacy between relatives, children watching the genitals of the parents (in the wide usage of the term) all constituted sexual offences in a given community. Society deal variously with these offences and African people are very sensitive to any departure from the accepted norm concerning all aspects of sex. This is a fundamentally religious attitude, since any offence upsets the smooth relationships of the community. Which includes those who have already departed. For this reason the offences must be followed by a ritual cleansing whether or not the offenders are physically punished, otherwise misfortunes may ensue(Shorter, 1999:95). Be that as it may, virginity is held to be a good thing insofar as it is a promise of a harmonious marriage. If a girl is chaste before her wedding she will probably be faithful after it. Adultery is vicious because it not only steal's the wife fertility, but kill the marriage. The bride price does not buy a woman, but rather compensate her family for her fertility. In general a man marries for life. Above all this applies to the first marriage; children cement the relationship, for their presence indicates that the contract has been fulfilled (Moler, 1982:4). I have continually contended that African traditional marriage system contained the proper ingredient to a healthy marriage. Africans understood marriage and sexuality and in their own rite, and had a way of upholding the richness of the value of marriage. But the 'husks' even though might not be 'foreign' to the African were not the prime motif for marriage, invariably one can conclude that the African marriage were stable. The 'husks', which is the exteriors in marriage, have been referred to severally. This was not the objective of marriage, meaning wealth, beauty, and other attributes were not solely the reasons for marriages, even though it was considered. Most African marriage were hinged on the centrality of life,",

Rozenn Hotte and Sylvie Lambert \u2217 May 18, 2020  ## Abstract  Bride price is essential to marriage in West Africa and particularly in Senegal where, according to our data, transfers to the family of the bride characterize about 85% of marriages.  The relationship between the bride price and the well-being of the wife in her household has scarcely been studied in West Africa. Furthermore, the simultaneous existence of other marriage payments, flowing in different directions between the stakeholders is also largely ignored. To assess the significance of these marital transfers for women's well-being in Senegal, we use a unique survey that enquires separately about the different marriage payments.  We highlight the strength of the link between what is given to the bride herself and her welfare, contrary to the looseness of the relation with what is given to the family.  JEL Classification: J12, J16, 055 Keywords: Bride-Price, Marriage, Women, Senegal.  ## 1 Introduction  In Senegal, marriage is nearly universal for women, and the social pressure to be married is extremely strong. Marriage and motherhood are important components of their social status and an essential part of their lives. Therefore, their welfare within marriage is a crucial aspect of women's well-being. Marital payments are pervasive in this country, bride price being the most important. According to our data, 85% of marriages that occurred between 1996 and 2006 involved a bride price. Bride prices exist in other contexts, as it is for example the main form of marital payments in rural China, Thailand, Sub-Saharan African and Middle-Eastern countries (Anderson, 2007), but this common denomination hides major contextual variations in this practice.  There is an on-going debate on the link between bride price and married women welfare.  In 2004, the International Conference on Bride Price, organized by MIFUMI, a women's rights NGO, in Kampala, Uganda, took a clear stands against it. This conference concluded by a resolution stating that the practice of bride price should be banned, as this was akin to the purchasing of women who therefore loose all agency on their fertility and sexuality (Wendo (2004)). An contrary assessment suggests that, since the bride price is paid when the wife has a positive value, it could reflect her bargaining power in her household and hence influence positively her access to household resources and her children outcomes.1 In this paper, we set out to elucidate the relationship between marital payments and married women welfare in the case of Senegal. It this context, several payments take place at the time of marriage, flowing in different directions between the stakeholders. We address the question of whether any of these payments is correlated to wives' welfare and propose a conceptual framework to understand the mechanisms at play.  Bride price is a transfer from the family of the groom to the family of the bride2. It has been studied in social sciences in particular through its ceremonial function, mostly by the anthropological literature (Drucker (1965), Kressel (1977)). It characterizes marriage markets where the search for a spouse is done by the groom's side, the groom and his kin trying to find the most desirable match. In marriage markets where dowries prevail, the search is conducted by the bride's side. The literature has devised models to explain the existence of such payment.  The bride price is seen as a compensation for the bride's parents, facing the loss of their daughter who represents an asset, or as a compensation for the bride herself (Becker, 1991). The role of women in agricultural labor-intensive societies is often put forward to explain the prevalence of bride-price over dowries in those societies, where it amounts to a payment for the transfer of the woman's workforce and the rights to her fertility from her parents' to her husband's household (Bell (2008), Boserup et al. (2013), Falen (2011)).  There are a number of reasons why bride price could affect the wellbeing of women in their marriage. The idea that bride price disenfranchises women is echoed in the economic literature, in particular about Uganda, by papers stressing the negative impact of bride price on women's independence and household decision making role (Kaye et al., 2005). Gaspart and Platteau (2010) stress another channel for a potential negative impact of the bride price on wives' welfare. In the context they study (the River Valley in Senegal), the bride price might have to be returned in case the woman leaves the relationship early in the marriage. The strategic model they develop implies that high bride price increases the groom's incentives to push his wife to ask for divorce, potentially using violence to this end. In the recent economic literature, Corno and Voena (2016) and Corno et al. (2016) have shown, using data on several countries of Africa, that the probability to have an early marriage is higher in case of negative shocks on family income, among societies that practice bride prices. Early marriage could be a way for families to smooth consumption, thanks in part to the receipt of the bride price.  Bride price might even at times be used as a proxy for bargaining power, because it is viewed as a substantial amount earned by the woman, which can participate to her empowerment or because it reflects her positive value for the husband (Doss (2013)). On the contrary, in the beckerian model, dowries would be negatively correlated with wives' welfare, as they exist when the value of the wives is negative. Consistent with this view, Mbaye and Wagner (2017) find that higher bride-price reduces fertility pressure in rural areas of Senegal. In a different setting, Mansoor (2018) also finds that higher bride price increases the probability of modern contraception use, interpreted as a sign of a higher bargaining power. In addition, Ashraf et al. (2014) show in Indonesia and Zambia, that construction of schools have increased the education of girls belonging to ethnic groups practicing high bride-price. Parents' strategic decision regarding their daughters marriage aiming at affecting timing or amount of bride-price can therefore have positive as well as negative impacts. Finally, in the context of the DRC, Lowes and Nunn (2016) show no systematic link between the amount of bride prices and earlier marriage or higher fertility.  Dowry and bride-price can be contrasted by the identity of the recipient of the transfer. The dowry can be seen as a pre-mortem inheritance and a way for parents to transmit inheritance to their daughter in a context of patrilocality (Goody and Tambiah, 1973), while bride price goes to the parents of the bride. Chan and Zhang (1999) suggest therefore that only the dowry and not the bride price should impact intra-household allocation of resources: they highlight implicitly the fact that the dowry being retained by the wife, contrary to the bride price, it does not enter her utility in the same way.  In total, how bride-price relates to the bride's wellbeing is still an open question and might well depend on the context.  In Senegal, bride price is the main marriage payment. Formally given by the groom and the groom's family to the bride's parents, it is the most systematic payment, but other transfers between the various parties are also commonly observed. Two important components of these transfers concern the bride herself. She receives a transfer from her husband, that will be hereafter referred to as *le cadeau* (i.e. the gift), as it is called in French, and she brings in the household a certain amount of resources, akin to a wedding trousseau (*le bagage*). It can therefore be expected that these marriage payments could relate differently to the wife's welfare, so that considering each of them separately seems necessary.  Marriage payments have rarely been analyzed in their full complexity, at least by economists.  Indeed, although a significant literature on dowries and bride prices exists, the fact that marriages give often rise to several simultaneous",

        "sentence_chunk": "payments (this is for example true also in Pakistan or Bangladesh, as presented by Ambrus et al. (2010)) is scarcely ever taken into account. This paper fills part of this gap.  In this paper, we use various proxies for the wife's wellbeing, ranging from individual consumption to fertility pressure. We assess the links between the diverse marriage payments and those outcomes. This is made possible thanks to the use of original data from the survey \"Pauvret\u00b4e et Structure familiale\" (thereafter, PSF), collected in Senegal in 2006 (de Vreyer et al., 2008). These data are particularly well suited for our objective, because they provide detailed information on transfers at the time of marriage, for every unbroken marriages: the bride price, the *cadeau* and the *bagage* are precisely recorded. They provide also information on consumption at disaggregated within-household level, allowing in particular to distinguish the consumption accruing to the wife from that of her husband.  This paper allows to dig deeper into the question of the link between marriages payments and intra-household resources allocation. To the best of our knowledge, our work is one of the first to detail the different transfers occurring at marriage and to show that they relate differently to wife's welfare. We nevertheless cannot claim to uncover causal links, as we have no source of exogenous variations for the amounts paid3. We develop a conceptual framework conform to anthropological knowledge and qualitative evidence that articulates a model of the determinants of marriage payments to the wife's welfare outcomes and serves as a guide to interpret the empirical findings. Empirically, results show that the bride price does not seem to correlate with the wife's access to household resources, nor with most other measures of wellbeing we have, contrary to the *cadeau* received from the husband. Results point at unobservable characteristics explaining both the existence and level of the *cadeau* and the relative consumption of the wife in the household (and more generally the wife's wellbeing), but uncorrelated to the bride price itself. The model suggests to interpret these unobservable variables as the value the husband attaches to his wife (or his love for her), that he signaled through the value of the cadeau.  Section 2 of the paper presents the context and the conceptual framework. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 highlights the determinants of the diverse marital payments. Section 5 analyses how those payments relate to women wellbeing, and offers an interpretation of those results. Section 6 presents the robustness checks. Finally, section 7 concludes.  ## 2 Marriage Payments In Senegal 2.1 Bride-Price, Cadeau And Bagage  Bride prices are present in most marriages in Senegal. They are transfers in kind or cash given by the family of the groom or the groom himself to the family of the bride. The bride price is given before the marriage. Although the marriage might have been arranged very early on, the payment of the bride-price is the signal allowing for the wife to join her husband's household and actually start a marital life. Its amount is negotiated between both couples of parents, largely on the basis of local norms. A large part of the bride price is spent in the wedding ceremony, for meals and clothing. The size of the wedding ceremony matters for families as, according to qualitative interviews, it is a way for the family of the bride to establish or comfort its social status. The wedding ceremony is notably an occasion for many gifts to be exchanged with all the guests. Thus, the part of the bride price that is not spent on ceremonial expenses is redistributed by the bride's mother to people deemed to deserve it, because they have played a role in the childhood of the bride or because they contribute to the ceremony. Nothing of the bride price is retained for future consumption. The guests (even if they didn't receive money from the bride's mother) also make a small monetary contribution (called *ndawtal*). The counterpart of this contribution will take place when they will themselves organize a ceremony. Wedding is therefore an essential occasion to strengthen the family social network, that could be mobilized again later, in particular for future marriages of the siblings. See Buggenhagen (2012) for a description of this gift/counter-gift dynamics and its role in maintaining an active social network.  Hence, even though bride's families receive a bride price, in the Senegalese context, it does not imply a real windfall earning at the occasion of their daughters' wedding. A long-term effect through the network may exist but the direct income shock caused by bride price is probably very limited. In some rare cases, a little part of the bride price could be given to the bride, but it is often spent for her ceremonial outfit. If bride prices have an effect on the parental network, it might percolate to the bride at some point, in a context where family is the natural insurance network and where transfers between generations are extremely common (La Ferrara (2010), Fafchamps and Quisumbing (2007)). Hence, bride price could still affect the well-being of the wife, but to a lesser extent than the one of her parents. This is consistent with the argument made by Chan and Zhang (1999).  The *cadeau* is given specifically by the husband to the bride. Traditionally, jewelry was offered, which constituted a precautionary saving that was retained by the wife and could be used in case of divorce or widowhood. It therefore played a similar role to the dower found in other Muslim countries. Nowadays, qualitative interviews suggest that it consists more in some conspicuous consumption goods such as smartphones or radios, as well as some money, at least in urban settings. It might therefore have lost its long term protective role. The *cadeau* is not mandatory to get married, contrary to the bride price. In fact, it is present in less than two thirds of the marriages we observe. As it is optional, controlling for the husband's wealth, it could represent a fairly accurate signal of the value the husband attaches to marrying this particular woman, and this is clearly the way many women interpret it4. Moreover, the *cadeau* is also often one of the first occasions to show commitment or involvement and for the husband to demonstrate that he values the individualized relationship.  The money of the *cadeau* can be used to partly cover for the cost of the *bagage*, which is the trousseau the wife brings into her new household. The wife's family also contributes to it. There is a lot of individual variation in the share of the *bagage* covered by the bride's own relatives and that covered thanks to the husband's contribution. This *bagage* takes the form of kitchen utensils, dishes and other housewares, as well as sometimes bedroom furnishing. It is essential in ensuring the wife's well-being in her new household: borrowing kitchen utensils from other women in the house is frowned upon. The content of the *bagage* remains the property of the bride alone. Because it often comes in large part from the bride's own family, its presence and level may well reflect the strength of the support she can expect from her kin group. In this sense, it might correlate with her outside options and affect her bargaining power within marriage.  Beyond the bride price, the *cadeau* and the *bagage*, a transfer in kind is sometimes made from the family of the bride to the family of the groom, mainly in the form of clothing for the wedding ceremony.  In case of divorce, in principle, the *cadeau* and the *bagage* remain the property of the bride.  Bride price is supposed to be paid back if the divorce is initiated by the woman and happens very early after the wedding. In practice, throughout the interviews we conducted in Senegal with divorced women, we never met anyone who had to reimburse the bride price, but we also observed that, when women initiate the divorce, it often means that they leave the house with hardly anything, leaving most of the *bagage* behind5.

        "sentence_chunk": "this paper reveal that, in the sample of women whose first marriage occurred in the 10 years preceding the survey (between 1996 and 2006), bride prices were given in 85% of the cases, *cadeau* received in 62% of them and the wife brought a *bagage* in 57% of those marriages (table 1). Amounts are also quite large as the mean bride price at first marriage is 125 000 (constant 2005) CFA francs (212 $) and the mean *cadeau* is 71 000 (2005) CFA francs (122 $), while the value of the *bagage* reaches on average 52 000 (2005) CFA francs (89 $) (table 2) 6. In one third of all marriages, the 3 types of transfers existed simultaneously (table A2 in the appendix7.). The sum of bride price and *cadeau* represents more than two thirds of the mean yearly consumption per capita in the country. Of note is the fact that bride price amounts are in principle regulated by the February 1967 law on ceremonial expenses and limited to 3000 CFA francs. This amount, that is much below observed levels, has not been adjusted since enactment of the law. 8 The simultaneous presence of these different transfers at marriage has never been studied. It echoes some work trying to understand simultaneous dowry and bride price (Bangladesh and Taiwan), but mainly in contexts of slow transition from one system to another. Here, the nature of those transfers differs in a deep way, and understanding their respective drivers and how they relate to married women welfare would shed light on this understudied aspect of the marital institution in Senegal.

In order to clarify potential mechanisms at play, we present here a simple model that articulates the determinants of the payments and the way they might correlate with the wife's wellbeing in her marital household9.  For marriages to take place, both families need to agree. The groom's kin discuss with the parents of the bride they have identified as a suitable match. The potential groom also has some say. Women who have never been married before have much less decision power than anyone else about the marriage itself. They nevertheless have a choice in terms on how they will behave with their husband during their future marital life. Both families and the groom talk over the bride-price, that should be sufficient for the bride's family to hold a wedding ceremony impressive enough to keep up with their social standing. What is appropriate is very much a matter of social norms prescribing what is expected from each family given their social status and the relation they already have with the future in-laws. It might also reflect the local marriage market. Besides, the groom has to decide whether to make a gift to his future wife and how much. The *cadeau* is a way for the groom to signal the fact that he actually aspires to this match. It might reassure the wife about the way he will behave with her in the future, by implicitly committing to provide her the required financial support10. The main objective of such a signal is to ensure the reciprocal wife's involvement in the marriage, meaning transfers (financial as well as emotional) toward her husband in future marital life. In fact, as in any repeated game, cooperating at the beginning of marriage helps ensuring cooperation in subsequent periods. The incentive to respect the commitment implied by the gift is ensured by the risk that a disappointed wife might ask for divorce (a very common occurrence in Senegal: in 2006, more than 13% of women older than 30 have divorced at least once, with divorce rates peaking between 2 and 5 years into the marriage as established by Lambert et al. (2018)).  The model below is designed to represent this situation with the simplifying assumption that the groom is the unique decision maker when it comes to both bride-price and *cadeau*, the position of other parties entering into play through minimum requirement constraints.  First, the groom (or his family) offers to pay a bride price BP. For this amount to be accepted and the marriage to be allowed, it cannot be below the one customarily determined by BP = BP(zw, zh*, m, sn*), where individual characteristics of both husband and wife are denoted by (zh, zw), m stands for the marriage market conditions favorable to men (gender imbalance for example) and sn the social norms that apply to a particular marriage (due to the ethnic affiliation, regional practices, families social standing...). zw could encompass for example age and education level of the bride. zh could represent husband's occupation (for instance whether this occupation goes hand in hand with a stable income). In the Senegalese context, where the bride-price results from negotiations at the family level and, as explained above, is relied upon by the bride's family to be able to organize a party that reinforce their social standing, we can expect it to be heavily constrained by existing norms (sn).  The amount of *cadeau* Ca is chosen once the bride price has been fixed11. Parents of the bride may have had a higher decision-making power than the bride herself in the initial acceptance. Nevertheless, the level of goodwill with which the bride enters the marriage might matter to the groom, as it will determine the level of harmony and mutual emotional transfers in the couple. The more he attaches importance to marrying this particular bride, the more he will be willing to ensure her good will. The *cadeau* is a signal sent to the bride once the match is decided and independently of the bargaining that occurs between the parents,used to convey the groom's inclination appropriately. Is also signals a commitment by the husband to offer financial support to his wife over the course of their marriage. This is not innocuous as a husband failing to meet this obligation despite initial commitment would face the risk of being punished by his wife, through lower transfers or even divorce. Men differ in their signaling cost as it would be less costly for a more loving husband to send such a signal.  We introduce a measure of the degree of premarital knowledge between the spouses. The potential bride directly observes the intensity of the interest of the groom towards her (denoted I, for involvement with the bride) with probability \u03c0. \u03c0 could be empirically proxied by the link between both families in-law: being from the same ethnic group or the same family would increase \u03c0. With probability (1-\u03c0), the bride does not know the groom's attachment and can only form expectations about it thanks to the *cadeau*. We assume that the bride needs to be induced to expect a certain level of care and involvement from her husband, (denoted Iw), to send positive emotional and financial transfers. The necessary *cadeau* for her expectation to reach this threshold is an",

        "sentence_chunk": "increasing function of the characteristics of the husband (zh). It is denoted Caw(zh). Below this amount, no cooperation will be obtained in marriage. The expectation of the groom's quality induced by the *cadeau* is therefore supposed to be an increasing function q(Ca \u2212 Caw(zh)) where q(0) = 0, q 0 > 0, q\" < 0. In other words, the bride's anticipation of the future involvement of the groom increases with the level of *cadeau* Ca, and is positive only if Ca exceeds the minimum amount she expects considering the characteristics of the husband. If really interested in this marriage, the groom seeks to send a signal that would exceed his expectation of the bride's threshold, as failing to meet the wife's anticipations would prevent him from reaping the utility gain associated with having an harmonious couple with the woman he actually cares for.  As noted above, men can differ in their interest in conciliating the bride. In our model, it means that men can differ in their signaling cost c, which is mostly an emotional cost. We suppose that c varies between 0 and 1. We assume moreover that the cost of signaling can be formalized as a decreasing function of two different factors: a component related to the observable characteristics of the wife (zw) and a less tangible (unobservable) component of attraction or love (l). The less the groom is in love with this woman, the more it costs him to give a *cadeau*. The utility associated with the emotional benefit of marrying this particular woman and having an harmonious marital life is denoted v(1 \u2212 c), where v is strictly increasing and concave. It can only be enjoyed if the signal sent leads the bride to expect a level of care that exceeds Iw, the involvement she requires to cooperate in the marriage. If the signal sent is below Iw, it leads to a disutility for the husband. For tractability, we assume that the function is continuous. As a result, we assume that the husbands utility from marrying this bride can then be written:  $$v(1-c)(\\pi I+(1-\\pi)q(C a-\\overline{{{C a_{w}}}}(z_{h}))-\\overline{{{I_{w}}}}(z_{h})).$$  For a little involved groom, v(1 \u2212 c) will be almost null, and the interest in increasing  $$\\pi I+(1-\\pi)q(C a-\\overline{{{C a_{w}}}}(z_{h}))-\\overline{{{I_{w}}}}(z_{h})$$  will be low, whereas not sending a valuable signal would be very damageable for the utility of a highly involved groom. We suppose that the utility of the groom is separable in consumption and involvement. The groom chooses the cadeau Ca maximizing:  $$U=u(Y_{h}-BP-Ca)+v(1-c(z_{w},l))(\\pi(I(z_{w},l))+(1-\\pi)q(Ca-\\overline{Ca_{w}}(z_{h}))-\\overline{I_{w}}(z_{h}))\\tag{1}$$  with Yh the income of groom, v the groom's signaling cost, and u and v are both strictly increasing and concave.  Under the constraint:  $$B P\\geq\\overline{{{B}}}\\overline{{{P}}}(z_{w},z_{h},m,s n)$$ BP \u2265 BP(zw, zh*, m, sn*) (2) $$\\left(2\\right)$$  Saturation of the constraint leads to:  $$B P={\\overline{{B P}}}(z_{w},z_{h},m,s n)$$ BP = BP(zw, zh*, m, sn*) (3) and the first order condition on Ca gives:  $$-u^{\\prime}(Y_{h}-\\overline{BP}(z_{w},z_{h},m,sn)-Ca)+v(1-c(z_{w},l))(1-\\pi)q^{\\prime}(Ca-\\overline{Ca_{w}}(z_{h}))=0\\tag{4}$$  For the bride price, the comparative statistics are directly obtained from the hedonic price function. For the gift, we compute the implicit derivatives:  \u2022\u2202Ca \u2202\u03c0 = \u2212 \u2212v(1 \u2212 c(zw, l))q 0(Ca \u2212 Caw(zh)) u 00 + v(1 \u2212 c(zw, l))(1 \u2212 \u03c0)q 00 < 0 \u2022\u2202Ca \u2202Yh = \u2212\u2212u 00 u 00 + v(1 \u2212 c(zw, l))(1 \u2212 \u03c0)q 00 > 0 \u2022\u2202Ca \u2202m = \u2212 u 00 \u2202BP \u2202m u 00 + v(1 \u2212 c(zw, l))(1 \u2212 \u03c0)q 00 > 0 \u2022\u2202Ca \u2202zh $$=\\,-\\frac{u^{\\prime\\prime}\\frac{\\partial B P}{\\partial z_{h}}-v(1-c(z_{w},l))(1-\\pi)q^{\\prime\\prime}\\frac{\\partial\\overline{{{C a_{w}}}}}{\\partial z_{h}}}{u^{\\prime\\prime}+v(1-c(z_{w},l))(1-\\pi)q^{\\prime\\prime}}$$  the positive effect of $z_{h}$ on $Ca_{w}$. The sign is  00 whose sign is ambiguous if \u2202BP \u2202zh> 0, given the positive effect of zh on Caw. The sign is positive if the link between the amount of gift requested by the wife and the characteristics of the husband is stronger than the one between these characteristics and the bride price.   $\\dfrac{\\partial Ca}{\\partial z_w}=-\\dfrac{u''\\frac{\\partial BP}{\\partial z_w}-\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z_w}v'(1-c(z_w,l))(1-\\pi)q'(Ca-\\overline{Ca_w}(z_h))}{u''+v(1-c(z_w,l))(1-\\pi)q''}\\quad$ whose sign is ambiguous ($\\frac{\\partial Ca}{\\partial z_w}>0$ if the link between education and willingness from the room to marry this .  peculiar wife is stronger than between education and bride price).  * $\\frac{\\partial Ca}{\\partial l}=-\\frac{-\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial l}v^{\\prime}(1-c(z_{w},l))(1-\\pi)q^{\\prime}(Ca-\\overline{Ca_{w}}(z_{h}))}{u^{\\prime\\prime}+v(1-c(z_{w},l))(1-\\pi)q^{\\prime\\prime}}>0$ Finally, these comparative statistics are obtained:  | Variables                          | Effect on gift   | Effect on bride price   |     | |------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-----| | Level of knowledge about the groom | -                | 0                       | (1) | | Income of the groom                | +                | 0                       | (2) | | Quality of the bride               | ?                | +                       | (3) | | Quality of the groom               | ?                | +                       | (4) | | Marriage market favorable to men   | +                | -                       | (5) | | Love                               | +                | 0                       | (6) |  In a second step, we focus on the situation during the marital life, once the ceremony has taken place. We suppose that the groom's love, or the harmony in the couple, plays positively on the financial support of the groom toward his wife. It would mean: S = S(l+ ) with S the financial support of groom, assuming other explanatory variables constant (fixed at the time of marriage). Since we are expecting that \u2202Ca \u2202l > 0, we also expect that \u2202S \u2202Ca > 0 whereas \u2202S \u2202BP = 0, controlling for observable variables that affect the occurrence of the marriage.12 Finally, the *bagage* does not appear in the above model, as the husband and his family have no say about it, even if it may also be partly financed by the *cadeau*. It is more likely to be determined by the support the bride can obtain from her own family and by the structure of the household she is planning to join (presence of co-wives or in-laws in particular). The role of her own family suggests that succeeding in raising a large *bagage* bodes well for future support from her kin group. As such it could be correlated with future income transfers for example, and therefore, higher individual consumption. Further, it might well reflect the strength of her outside options, and hence contributes to a higher bargaining power within the household.  We will bring these predictions to the data. First, we will be interested in the correlates of the marriage payments and simply estimate :  $$P_{i}=g(s n_{i},z_{h i},z_{w i},m)+v_{i}$$ Pi = g(sni, zhi, zwi, m) + vi(5) $\\left(5\\right)$.  Where P stands for payment, which can be either a bride-price (BP), a *cadeau* (Ca) or a bagage (T). Some unobservable factors linked to personality traits of husband and wife and the interpersonal quality of the match, are likely to enter into play for all these payments in the v.  Love in the model is encompassed in the error term of the *cadeau* regression (vCA).  In a second step, we will be interested in the link between the payments and the welfare of the wife in her new household, after the marriage. Here again, we will simply exhibit regularities thanks to the following set of regressions:  $$Y_{i}=g(m,s n_{i},z_{h i},z_{w i},C a_{i}(l),B P_{i})+u_{i}$$ $\\left(\\mathrm{6}\\right)$.   Our model suggests that the coefficient associated to Cai should be significantly positive while the one associated to BPi might not be significantly different from zero. Indeed, controlling for the observable variables that affect both the payment and the wife's outcomes, we expect unobservable characteristics captured by the *cadeau* more than by the bride price (kindness of the husband, quality of the marriage, harmony in the couple) to play a role",

Data have been collected in 2006 and are nationally representative. It covers 1750 households, and 14 450 individuals. The survey recorded all the marital transfers: bride-price, *cadeau* and *bagage*14.  This level of detail is very rare. Data sets that record bride-prices or dowries usually stop at this single (main) marital transfers. There are few exceptions concerning Bangladesh and Pakistan, countries where bride-price and dowry tend to increasingly coexist (Ambrus et al., 2010). In the Senegalese context, the practice of multiple marital transfers, in addition to the nearly universal bride-price, is widespread. These marital payments are self-recorded, asked to the husband when he is present, to his wife otherwise: as such, they can be biased (beyond a random measurement error). We do not think that the bias would systematically correlate with the outcomes considered at the time of survey, but maybe, rather to the education level of the bride or the consumption level of the household. We control for these variables in the analysis.  Consumption The PSF survey collects information on food and non-food expenditures. The recall period is chosen for each good by the respondent, expenditures have then been annualized. A particular strength of the data set is that it takes into account the intra-household allocation of consumption. Qualitative interviews have shown that each household could be split into semi-autonomous budgetary units. Between these subgroups, sharing of financial responsibilities is very clearly defined and own resources are not pooled. In the quantitative data, we have reproduced this natural division of the household, calling each unit a cell. These cells are composed of a cell-head and his dependents: wife, children, or unaccompanied members of the family. Household head are however systematically recorded in an autonomous cell, that includes only their unaccompanied dependent (children whose mother does not coreside or widowed parent for example). Their wives each head a separate cell. Adult male members, other than the head of household, receive different treatment, depending on whether or not they are polygamous. They are in the same cell than their wife if they are monogamous, or in different cells if they are polygamous. Given this rule, most women heading a cell of their own are either household head or married to the household head15. Their husband should not be in their cell, except if they do not live in the same household and he is visiting at the time of the survey.  This happened for 10 women in our sample.  Consumption is recorded in three parts: consumption common to the whole household, consumption that can be assigned to specific cells and finally, consumption shared between several cells but not the whole household. Total cell consumption can be constructed by ascribing a share proportional to cell size of the common or shared expenditures and adding cell specific expenses. Intra-household inequality in access to consumption can therefore be exhibited. Individuals within the same household do not have always the same consumption level. It appears that food consumption is rather equally shared within a household, while it is not the case for non-food consumption (de Vreyer and Lambert, 2020) 16. We will consider the ratio of the woman's cell per capita non-food consumption to that of her household as a measure of her access to household resources. The share of the household consumption that comes down to the wife is actually a direct measure of her welfare. This measure should reflect her bargaining power according to classical collective household models. It gives a fairly encompassing picture of wife's welfare within the household and informs on what really matters *in fine*, the share of total resources accruing to her. Note that for those women who are not in a independent cell, they are generally in their husbands' cell and the resources reaching the cell also reflect the position of the couple in the household. Although it represents a situation where what is at stake is not what can be obtained from the husband, this is nevertheless one dimension of her situation within the household.  For each consumption record in the survey, the persons who financed the corresponding expenditures are registered. We can therefore consider another outcome reflecting the support the husband provides to his wife, the share of the wife's cell consumption that is financed by the husband. We are nevertheless aware that this measure is ambiguous. A high level of husband's support could also mean less autonomy, and therefore less welfare. This is the same ambiguity than the one attached to the wife's income, highlighted by Doss (1996): wife's income is not a good measure of the bargaining power, since a woman with a high bargaining power could decide not to work. Note that consumption data do not suffer from this ambiguity. We complete this analysis by studying other outcomes that can proxy women's welfare, such as fertility pressure, polygamy and coresidence with the in-laws. This is detailed in section 5.  Sample Amounts recorded for the marriage payments possibly suffer from recall bias. To try to circumscribe this problem, we limit our sample to women who have been married in the 10 years preceding the survey, hence after 1996. The sample for which information on the amount of each marriage payments is available contains 783 women once trimmed for outliers17.  Among them, we have information on control variables for 751. We have full information on the husband only in case of co-residence of the couple: 521 women coreside with their husband (69% of the sample)18. The analysis of financial support of the husband will be restricted to the sample of wives who are cell's head and not in the same cell than the husband (465). The measure of financial support would not be relevant if husband and wife are recorded in the same cell as their consumption would not be separately recorded. We check robustness to the sample definition first by restricting in turn the analysis to women in their first marriages (638 women, among them 370 cell's head) and to coresiding women (521 women, among them 310 cell's head19), and then by enlarging the sample to women having been married in the 15 years preceding the survey (989, among them 660 are cell's head). The table A3 in Appendix presents a summary of the number of observations in these different samples of interest.  Married Women's Characteristics Table 4 provides descriptive statistics for women in our main sample.20 Twenty three percents of those women have a primary education and 12% have a secondary education. Half of the sample lives in a rural area. The age at marriage is on average 22 years old (note that for some of these women, the marriage observed is not their first marriage, hence the rather high age at marriage reported here), and the age gap with the husband is 12 years.  Three quarters of them live in a monogamous union at the time of the survey.21  | N                                                                | Mean   | SD    |       | |------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------|-------| | Wife with some primary education                                 | 751    | 0.23  | 0.42  | | Wife with secondary or superior education                        | 751    | 0.12  | 0.32  | | Age of the wife at marriage                                      | 751    | 22.42 | 8.86  | | Age Difference between spouses                                   | 650    | 11.60 | 7.81  | | Log of the expenditures of the hh pc                             | 751    | 12.32 | 0.76  | | Wife lives in a rural place                                      | 751    | 0.51  | 0.50  | | In a monogamous union                                            | 751    | 0.75  | 0.43  | | In a polygamous union, first rank",

To analyze the correlates of the various payments, we first estimate the probability that such transfers occur at the time of marriage, and then the amount paid. Explanatory variables are grouped into different sets. A first set describes the local environment and aims at approaching the role of local norms. It includes the region of residence of the couple (as a proxy of the region of residence of the parents of the husband), dummies for ethnic group, and average per capita consumption at the district level (to control for the wide geographic disparities in living standards). 22 It also includes date (year) of marriage and conditions of the local marriage market at that time captured by the women-to-men sex ratio in the district of residence of the wife (following Chiappori et al. (n.d.) or Abramitzky et al. (2011))23. A second set of variables reflects the endogamy of the match in various dimensions (spouse members of the same family, of the same ethnic groups, or with fathers having the same employment status).  Greater endogamy might have improve the information the wife had about her husband prior to the wedding. On the other hand, highly endogamous marriage are more likely to have been arranged by the families, without regards for the wishes of the spouses. Characteristics of the families form the third group of variables: professional occupation of the wife's father (whether employer, employee, civil servant, formal or informal worker, farmer or inactive), wife's parents alive at the time of marriage and size of the sibset of each spouse. Finally, individual characteristics of the wife and husbands form the lasts sets: education and occupation are accounted for.  We investigate for all married women the link between the dependent variable and those sets of characteristics. Results are presented in table 5 for the logit estimation of the probability of a given transfer taking place and in table table 6) for the corresponding amounts (Given the share of null payments, we conduct this analysis using a tobit specification). For the subset of women who coreside with their husband, more information is available, and we present the results for this sample using a wider set of explanatory variables. The results restricted to the smaller set of variables common to all observations are presented in Appendix (tables A4 and A5). They are very similar to the ones with the whole sample of married women.24 For both existence and level of the bride price, explanatory variables related to region and date of marriage have jointly a significant explanatory power. Ethnicity also plays a role, Wolof families receiving a higher bride price. The district level women-to-men ratio plays negatively on this transfer, showing the weight of local conditions on the marriage market. This is true controlling for the average consumption level in the department that could well be correlated with the sex ratio if men migrate to earn a living. As expected, this measure of local living standard is positively correlated with the bride-price. The characteristics of the wife enter into play as well. Her age at marriage affects the probability a bride price is paid, this being lower for older brides, while her education affects its amount: women with secondary or higher education command higher bride price. Remember that women with this level of education are only 12% of our sample, and this achievement may be as indicative of her family social standing than of her own quality. It is also noteworthy that higher bride-prices are paid when at least one of the parents of the bride is alive at the time of marriage. In fact, parents are really the ones who rely on the bride-price to reaffirm their social standing and have therefore higher stakes in negotiating it. Higher bride prices are also paid if the husband is a farmer. On the other hand, consistent with the conceptual framework, belonging to the same family or the same ethnic group is not significantly correlated with the amount of bride price. Regarding the cadeau or the *bagage*, it is worth noting that if they also vary by region and marriage dates, they do not vary by district consumption level and marriage market conditions, supporting the notion that these payments are determined at a more individualized level than bride prices. The *cadeau* seems to be driven more by characteristics of the husband, for both the probability of a *cadeau* to be given (particularly strong when the husband is a farmer) and for the value of the *cadeau*: husbands who already had a job at the time of marriage and men at both end of the socio-economic spectrum (civil servant or employer on the one hand, and farmer and educated in koranic school on the other) give higher *cadeaux*. Belonging to the same family, or to the same ethnic group probably induces a better prior mutual knowledge. The model suggests that it would make signaling from the groom less necessary, and we indeed find that belonging to the same ethnic group is negatively correlated with the *cadeau*, both in terms of occurrence and value. Belonging to the same family is not correlated with the existence nor the amount of the *cadeau*, except that it increases the probability to receive a *cadeau* when considering all married women (but not when restricting to co-residing wives). Note however that in most cases, belonging to the same family also means belonging to the same ethnic group, and the total effect is always significantly negative. Among possible interpretations for the positive correlation that appears when considering the probability to receive a *cadeau*, we can",

        "sentence_chunk": "imagine either that a *cadeau* can be exchanged also when spouses already know each other, precisely because they love each other or that endogamous marriage are more often arranged by the families so that the man needs to make a special effort to signal his personal interest above and beyond the family desire to see this particular marriage happen. Finally, the *bagage* is more likely to exist if the husband is a farmer and when the fathers of the spouse share the same occupation.  Unfortunately, the information on the income of the husband at the time of the marriage is not available in the survey. But thanks to retrospective data on the first job, we are able to compute a dummy indicating whether the husband had worked before the year of the marriage. As expected, it is positively correlated with the amount of the *cadeau* but not the one of the bride price.  In total, all those results can be read through the lens of the conceptual framework developed above, that allows to make sense of the patterns just described. Bride price payments appear to be decided mainly to accord with local standards that vary per region, ethnic group, local standard of living, local sex-ratio at the time of marriage, whether the bride's parents are alive, for women of a given age and education level. On the contrary, the *cadeau* seems to be more individualized, the characteristics of the spouses playing a greater role. The negative correlation between ethnic endogamy and the *cadeau* can be understood in our framework by the fact that signaling one's good will is more important for the husband if he is more distant from his future wife to start with.

The idea is that in societies where bride prices are paid at the time of marriage, parents could be tempted to marry their daughter off early when facing a negative income shock, so as to be able to use the pride price payment to smooth consumption. The results obtained suggest a wide variety of situations. If Corno and Voena (2016) show that drought can indeed accelerate the timing of the marriage and decrease bride price paid, Lowes and Nunn (2016) do not find this for Democratic Republic of Congo. We study here how the Senegal marriage markets react to transitory local income shocks.  We consider weather shocks at the time when women were at risk of being married for the first time, using rainfall deviation from the long term average. Rainfall data measured every month from 1982 to 2007 at the district level are matched to every individual in the survey, based on the district of residence of the wife at the time of the PSF survey25. This is the district she married into, so, as argued before, it is likely to be a good proxy for the district of residence of the husband's family. It makes sense to use this, as the husband's family is the one who will have to pay the bride-price, and their capacity to do so might be affected by adverse shocks.  The district of current residence of the wife is probably a noisier proxy of the exact localization of the wife's family. The district of birth of the wife is more appropriate to account for it, and would be the relevant one if indeed girl's parents adjusted marriage timing to cope with shocks. We also used it in an alternative specification.  To construct a measure of rainfall shock, district and year rainfall averages are first computed, and long-term average is obtained by taking the mean of the yearly rainfall average over the twenty five years for which the information is available26. For each household and each year, we define positive (negative) rainfall shocks as situations where the rainfall average that year is more than one standard deviation above (below) the long-term average. Descriptive statistics on the occurrence of shocks are available in Table 7.  | count                                    | mean   | sd       | min      | max   |    | |------------------------------------------|--------|----------|----------|-------|----| | Negative shock at 16, 17 or 18 years old | 690    | .2086957 | .4066712 | 0     | 1  | | Positive shock at 16, 17 or 18 years old | 690    | .3391304 | .4737576 | 0     | 1  |  Note: A negative (positive) shock is a rainfall level that is more than one standard deviation below (above) the long-term average any of the 3 years when the woman was age 16 to 18. Sample: Women married between 1996 and 2006.  Since the timing of the marriage is endogenous, we look at the occurrence of a shock during the period when marriage risk is highest for girls, i.e. when the bride to be is 16, 17 and 18 years old. We are not able to have these data for the older women of the sample, as rain data starts only in 1982. Therefore, we run the model including those variables only for the subsample of 690 women for whom we can construct a measure of rainfall shock. Results indicate that dry years tend to delay marriages. We do not find any impact of rainfall shocks on the amount paid as bride price, but a negative one on the level of *cadeau*(Table 8). In this context, the adjustment to drought on the marriage market passes mainly through quantities (marriage postponement). It is consistent with the fact that the amount of the bride price has to respect a norm that cannot easily be disregarded. People wait for better time to marry in order to be able to pay the required amount. At the same time, since the *cadeau* is not required, if the marriage",

Unexplained variance could be ascribed to two non-exclusive factors: a first one is measurement error. Indeed, although we restricted the sample to relatively recent marriages, the recall or reporting might be imperfect. The other possibility is the role of unobservable characteristics such as the kindness of the husband, the value he attaches to marry this woman, the outside options on the marriage market of this particular woman. Analyzing how those transfers correlate with welfare outcomes of the wife after marriage will help us assessing whether noise dominates or whether the payments recorded carry relevant signal, above and beyond the one contained in observable characteristics.  ## 5 Wives' Wellbeing 5.1 Empirical Strategy  To study how measures of women's individual welfare correlate with the various marital payments, controlling for observable characteristics, we estimate the following linear equation:  $$Y_{i,h,m}=\\alpha_{0}+\\beta_{1}G_{i}+\\beta_{2}BP_{i}+\\beta_{3}T_{i}+\\gamma X_{i,h,m}+\\mu_{r}+\\nu_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i,h}\\tag{7}$$  where subscripts i, h, m and r denote respectively individual, household, husband and region28. Y*i,h,m* represents an indicator of the wife's wellbeing in her household. Giis the *cadeau* she received at marriage, BPi, the bride-price paid and Ti the value of the trousseau. X*i,h,m* are characteristics of the wife, her household and her husband. \u00b5r are regional dummies and \u03bdt dummies for the marriage year. \u03b5i,h is the error term, clustered at the husband level.  The wife's access to household's resources is the first dimension of her wellbeing studied here. As indicated in section 3, we look at two different variables. On the one hand, we consider the ratio of per capita non-food consumption of the wife's cell to the mean per capita non-food consumption of the household On the other hand, we use the share of the individual consumption of the wife's cell that is financed by the husband. For this latter outcome, we focus on women who are coresiding with their husband and limit the sample to wives who are not registered in the same cell as their husbands (mainly wives of household heads), as the survey design insures that their consumption is collected separately from that of their husband. The other outcomes considered are some non-monetary proxies of the strength of the wife's position in the household: the probability to have become polygamous since marriage and the coresidence with her in-laws (remaining monogamous and obtaining a dwelling independent from the in-laws are very clearly preferred living arrangements) and the time interval between marriage and firth birth, as a measure of fertility pressure. Given that women in this sample married rather recently, we cannot investigate the correlates of their children's educational outcomes.  of children and adults of the household and of the cell, the status of the wife in her household (wife of a monogamous man, first wife of a polygamous man, or wife of higher rank) except when we consider polygamy as an outcome, as well as for characteristics that appeared as important determinants of the marriage payments: education of the wife, the age at marriage and the type of activities of her father, and of the groom himself.  We are not claiming that the relation between the payments and the welfare measures of the wife should be causal. As underlined in the conceptual framework, unobserved characteristics of the wife and the husband might well affect both the existence and level of marriage payments and the access to household resources or generally the bargaining position of the wife. It is still of interest to exhibit regularities in these relations and use the conceptual framework developed above to interpret them.  ## 5.2 Results  Table 9 shows that the wife's relative access to non-food consumption in the household is positively related to the value of the *cadeau* received, but neither to the bride-price paid or to the *bagage* brought in the household, once controlling for the wife's education and occupation of her father and husband29. For the sample of the women whose cell is not the one of their husband (Table 10), the results are qualitatively similar, but the significance of the coefficient of the *cadeau* disappears when we control simultaneously for other marital payments. When looking at the financial support of the husband, the correlation with the *cadeau* is positive and significant, including when we control for the other payments, while, here again, this is not the case for the bride price. It is of note that wives who are in a different cell than the",

        "sentence_chunk": "one of their husband and those who are registered with their husband differ in a number of diemnsions as shown in the Table A8. Women who are not in the cell of their husband belong to richer households and have a lower relative consumption30. They are very often wives of household head and more frequently in a polygamous union.  The magnitude of the association between the *cadeau* and the financial support of the husband is not negligible. A *cadeau* 100000 CFA Francs higher (about one standard deviation of the distribution of *cadeau* amounts, including zeros) increases the financial support of the husband by nearly 4.4 percentage points, i.e. 9% of the mean). This is true controlling for a number of variables that are likely to capture the income of the husband (household per capita consumption, husband's occupation, wife's father's occupation), and for any other significant correlates of the amount of the *cadeau*. The wealth of the husband's household of origin is probably not at play either here, as it would also generate a correlation with the bride-price. It rather suggests that this correlation is driven by unobserved characteristics explaining both the importance of the *cadeau* and the financial support provided by the husband to his wife.  Those unobservables might relate to the specificity of the match between these two persons, such as her ex-ante bargaining power, or the love of her husband. The correlation between the husband financial support and the *bagage* is also strong, even if it looses statistical significance when other marital payments are controlled for. This might not come as a surprise since part of the *cadeau* can be used to fund the *bagage*. In any case, the correlation with the bride price is very low and never statistically significant.  The amount of the *cadeau* is correlated with a lower probability of coresidence with the in-laws (Table 11). It is not significantly (but positively) correlated with the probability of the husband having taken a new wife since the marriage and having thereby become a polygamist.  Note that, on average, husbands take a second wife 10 years after their first marriage, so that the time interval we consider might be too narrow to detect a significant correlation. The results are unaltered when looking at a 15 years span (see section 6.1.  31. Concerning time interval before first birth, we use a Cox model, including an interaction between the marital payments and the time (in years) since the proportional hazard assumption is not respected (Table 12).  A higher *cadeau* is associated with a longer time between marriage and first birth (since the hazard ratio is inferior to 1), which implies a lower pressure on fertility. This effect decreases over time, as could be expected, since giving birth is one of the marital obligations. The same is true for the bride price, although the risk reduction is lower than that brought by a *cadeau*.  is the marriage payment for which the husband benefits from some individual margin of manoeuvre, and through which he can express his kindness or endearment and/or through which he commits to future good behavior. It translates into rather positive outcomes for the wife, in particular a relatively good access to household's resources and better living arrangements.  Since we control for various observable variables in the above regressions and in particular for the per capita consumption in the household, it suggests that unobservable variables, such as the husband's love for his wife, indeed play a role to explain both the level of the *cadeau* and the future welfare of the wife. Conversely, bride-price which appears to be strongly based on social norms and rather little individualized does not seem to correlate at all with the wife's bargaining power in her marital household. These results suggest that the *cadeau* is a more powerful predictor of the wife's position in her household than the bride-price.  | Table 9:                                                                                                            | Relative non food consumption of the wife's cell in the household (per capita) (1) (2) (3) (4)   |            |            |            | |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------| | Deflated amount of Cadeau                                                                                           | 0.6153***                                                                                        | 0.5993***  |            |            | | (0.17)                                                                                                              | (0.18)                                                                                           |            |            |            | | Deflated amount of Bride price                                                                                      | 0.1294                                                                                           | 0.1296     |            |            | | (0.12)                                                                                                              | (0.12)                                                                                           |            |            |            | | Deflated amount of Bagage                                                                                           | 0.3668                                                                                           | 0.1417     |            |            | | (0.24)                                                                                                              | (0.24)                                                                                           |            |            |            | | Wife with some primary education                                                                                    | 0.0987**                                                                                         | 0.1134**   | 0.1119**   | 0.0951**   | | (0.04)                                                                                                              | (0.05)                                                                                           | (0.05)     | (0.04)     |            | | Wife with secondary or superior education                                                                           | 0.1565***                                                                                        | 0.1654***  | 0.1707***  | 0.1396**   | | (0.06)                                                                                                              | (0.06)                                                                                           | (0.06)     | (0.06)     |            | | Age of the wife at marriage                                                                                         | 0.0032                                                                                           | 0.0027     | 0.0026     | 0.0037     | | (0.00)                                                                                                              | (0.00)                                                                                           | (0.00)     | (0.00)     |            | | Log of the expenditures of the hh pc                                                                                | -0.1142***                                                                                       | -0.1037*** | -0.1046*** | -0.1193*** | | (0.03)                                                                                                              | (0.03)                                                                                           | (0.03)     | (0.03)     |            | | Wife lives in a rural place",

Source PSF 2006  ## 6 Robustness Analysis  The sample used in the main analysis includes all women, whose marriage took place in the 10 years preceding the survey. We chose to restrict the analysis to this time span in order to limit recall difficulties. We can nevertheless conduct the same analysis extending the sample to women married earlier. Further, those women are very heterogeneous in terms of their marriage: for a number of them, the marriage we observed is not the first one, and not all of them co-reside with their husband. These situations are not exogenous and might be associated with specific marriage payments patterns. We therefore repeat the previous analysis varying the sample used to check the robustness of the results obtained so far. The table 13 displays for the various outcomes the coefficients of the three types of marital payments obtained when replicating the analysis on different sub-samples. The first column repeats the main results.  ## 6.1 Selection On The Year Of Marriage  We first extend the sample to all women who married in the fifteen years before the survey.  Results are extremely consistent. As shown in the second column of table 13, the *cadeau* is positively correlated with the relative non food consumption of the wife, and with the financial support of the husband for women heading their cell and not in the same cell as their husband.  Results are also similar for the other outcomes (except for the duration between marriage and first birth, where the correlation is no more significant), the *cadeau* being linked positively with favorable welfare outcomes.  ## 6.2 First Marriages  For the main analysis of the paper, we focus on all marriages to avoid selection effects. Nevertheless, it mixes two situations than can be very different, the first marriage and further marriages. Indeed, second marriages are relatively frequent in Senegal, following widowhood or divorce. And women who remarry differ from women in their first marriage in a number of dimensions (see Table A11 in the appendix). Furthermore, first marriages are characterized by a higher involvement of the family of both spouses in the match. For this reason, we expect them to go hand in hand with specific characteristics in terms of marital payments.  As visible in Table A12 in the appendix, marital payments can more often be dispensed  | Table 13: Wives' welfare outcomes and marriage payments, using different samples All Over 15 years First marriages Coresident Relative consumption of the wife Deflated amount of Cadeau 0.599*** 0.402** 0.600*** 0.369* (0.18) (0.16) (0.19) (0.22) Deflated amount of Bride price 0.130 0.128 0.147 0.140 (0.12) (0.10) (0.14) (0.16) Deflated amount of Bagage 0.142 0.029 -0.017 0.039 (0.24) (0.20) (0.24) (0.29) Controls Individual Yes Yes Yes Yes Mean Dep.

Bride price and *bagage* in particular are much less frequent in case of re-marriage than for first marriages. By contrast, the occurrence of *cadeau* is only slightly decreased by the number of marriages.  Results on the correlation between marital payments and wife's welfare outcomes are presented for women in their first marriages in the third column of table 13. The correlation between the *cadeau* and the relative non food consumption of the wife is positive and significant in this sub-sample as well. As for the main sample, significance disappears when restricting the analysis to those who are registered in an independent cell32. The correlation between the *cadeau* and the financial support of the husband remains significantly positive. For these women, the cadeau is also correlated with lower fertility pressure and lower likelihood of coresidence with the in-laws.  ## 6.3 Selection On The Residence Status  We also test whether the results obtained hold when restricting the sample to women coresiding with their husband. Non-coresidence happens either very early in the marriage, before the newlyweds are allowed to settle together (after the bride-price is fully paid and when the husband had the means to provide a home to his wife), or when the husband commutes between his rural home and his urban job, therefore having two separate households, or finally when the wife has obtained an independent dwelling, in particular when joining a polygamous household. It is to be expected that this set of women differs from co-residing ones. In fact, table A13 in the appendix shows that non-coresiding women are older at marriage, more likely to reside with one of their parent and more likely to be in a polygamous union.  In addition, bride price and *bagage* are more frequently exchanged when the wife is coresiding with the husband, as seen in Table A14 in appendix. It is consistent with qualitative interviews according to which one condition for the bride to join the conjugal home is that every payment has been made. They are also larger in case of co-residence. Interestingly, neither the occurrence nor the amount of the *cadeau* are significantly different according to coresidence status: it underlines that the logic explaining the amount of *cadeau* is very different of the one explaining the amount of bride price.  Results on the relation between marital payments and wife's welfare are replicated for the sample of co-residing wives in the last column of table 13. They are very close to those obtained with the original sample. The *cadeau* is positively and significantly related to the relative non food consumption of the cell of the wife (the correlation being nevertheless negative, although not significantly different from zero when considering only women who are not in the cell of their husband). The *cadeau* is also still positively and significantly correlated with the husband financial support. Qualitatively, the coefficients of marital payments in the regression describing the probability of coresidence with in-laws are similar to those obtained in the main sample, even if the coefficient attached to the *cadeau* lost its statistical significance. Fertility pressure is significantly reduced by a large *cadeau* to a similar extend in this sample, compared to the main one.  ## 6.4 Heterogeneity By Consumption Level  A natural question is whether the correlations presented so far differ for richer and poorer households. When considering separately households whose consumption per capita is below (\"poor\") or above (\"rich\") the median, we see in particular that bride prices are paid as often in both groups, while the *cadeau* is more often absent in poor households. This is graphically apparent in the figures 2 and 1, that represent the density of the amount of bride price and cadeau paid, separately for the two groups of households. The discrepancy between the two samples is higher for the *cadeau*, with in particular a greater distance between the two curves at 0 for the *cadeau* (figure 2) than for the bride price (figure 1). It is in line with the existence of a quasi-obligation to pay a bride price that does not apply to the *cadeau*, for which the grooms have more room for manoeuvre. This is also consistent with the greater impact of husband's income on the *cadeau*.",

The bride price plays in opposite direction for both group, positively and significantly for the richest group, negatively, but not significantly so, for the poorest (Table 14). Focusing on the husband support (Table 15), results are significant only for the wealthiest group (and at the 12% level), which is consistent with the fact that it is easier for richer husbands to send the signal, since they have enough financial resources to pay a *cadeau* once the mandatory bride price is paid.  | level                                     |                                  |                               |          |           | |-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------|-----------| | All women                                 | Not in the cell of their husband |                               |          |           | | Below the median of hh conso.             | Above                            | Under the median of hh conso. | Above    |           | | Deflated amount of Cadeau                 | 0.9907***                        | 0.5543**                      | 0.1075   | 0.3838    | | (0.36)                                    | (0.23)                           | (0.32)                        | (0.30)   |           | | Deflated amount of Bride price            | -0.3316                          | 0.2401                        | -0.1374  | 0.0975    | | (0.20)                                    | (0.15)                           | (0.22)                        | (0.20)   |           | | Deflated amount of Bagage                 | -0.3266                          | 0.4260                        | -0.1096  | 0.3874    | | (0.40)                                    | (0.32)                           | (0.47)                        | (0.34)   |           | | Wife with some primary education          | 0.1589**                         | 0.0500                        | 0.1280*  | 0.0202    | | (0.07)                                    | (0.06)                           | (0.07)                        | (0.08)   |           | | Wife with secondary or superior education | 0.1046                           | 0.0899                        | 0.4045** | 0.0399    | | (0.16)                                    | (0.07)                           | (0.18)                        | (0.09)   |           | | Age of the wife at marriage               | 0.0007                           | 0.0058*                       | 0.0012   | 0.0028    | | (0.00)                                    | (0.00)                           | (0.00)                        | (0.00)   |           | | Log of the expenditures of the hh pc      | -0.0845                          | -0.1365***                    | -0.0940  | -0.1238*  | | (0.06)                                    | (0.05)                           | (0.08)                        | (0.07)   |           | | Wife lives in a rural place               | 0.0999                           | -0.0315                       | 0.1109   | -0.0456   | | (0.07)                                    | (0.08)                           | (0.08)                        | (0.10)   |           | | Constant                                  | 2.3011***                        | 2.7441***                     | 2.3006** | 2.6111*** | | (0.75)                                    | (0.64)                           | (0.96)                        | (0.85)   |           | | Region and time FE                        | Yes                              | Yes                           | Yes      | Yes       | | Other Controls Wife                       | Yes                              | Yes                           | Yes      | Yes       | | Controls Husband                          | Yes                              | Yes                           | Yes      | Yes       | | Controls Composition                      | Yes                              | Yes                           | Yes      | Yes       | | Number of married women                   | 377                              | 374                           | 233      | 232       | | Mean                                      | 1.02                             | 1.00                          | 0.98     | 0.95      | | Standard Deviation                        | 0.45                             | 0.47                          | 0.40     | 0.45      | | r2                                        | 0.29                             | 0.26                          | 0.34     | 0.34      | | * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.          |                                  |                               |          |           |  | Table 15:                                  | Heterogeneity according to HH conso - Wives not in the cell of their husband Financial Support of the Husband Under the median of hh conso.

Using a dataset that uniquely records all the payments exchanged between the families and the future spouses at the time of marriage, we dig into the multiplicity of marital payments in Senegal and exhibit clear differences in both the way they are determined and the way they correlate with married women's welfare.  We show that the *cadeau* received directly by the wife from her husband and the brideprice paid to the bride's family depart from each other in the fact that the first one is rather individualized, while the level of the bride-price seems to respond to social norms that cannot easily be escaped. Our conceptual framework rationalizes how those differences translate into contrasting patterns of correlation with the wife's welfare: while there exists a clear link between the *cadeau* the wife received from her husband at marriage and our various measures of her current welfare, no such a link can be exhibited for the bride price.  Obviously, the amounts of the marital payments are endogenous and regarding the *cadeau*, it seems that the unobserved source of endogeneity is positively correlated with both the size of the *cadeau* and the woman access to household's resources, or more generally her welfare in the household. Guided by our conceptual framework, we interpret this as to be mainly due to the strength of the amity or the love of the husband for his wife. As a result, because it reflects better the relation between spouses, the *cadeau* is likely to be a better proxy of wife's bargaining power than the bride-price in the context studied in this paper.  ## References  Abramitzky, Ran, Adeline Delavande, and Luis Vasconcelos, \"Marrying Up: The Role of Sex Ratio in Assortative Matching,\" *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*, July 2011, 3 (3), 124\u2013157.

It particularly examines the signification of its linguistic elements as transition vehicle that convey the bride through *the pre liminal, liminal and* post liminal stages of her rite of passage. The study adopts qualitative research technique to critically analyse and interpret the linguistic (lexical/verbal words, phrases, and sentences) and non-linguistics (non-verbal pictorials, facial expressions, emotions) elements in the music drama deployed as semiotics resources in this work from the social and cultural semiotics perspectives. The study concludes that the identified linguistic and non-linguistic elements of the drama music used as data in this work are the Yoruba semiotics resources, which their imports give *physical* and psychological *strength to a bride, in the marriage's rite of passage.* KEY WORD: linguistic/non-linguistic, rite of passage, ritual, semiotics, signification, transition, Yoruba traditional marriage.  ## Introduction  There are different commemorative rituals in the African socio cultural settingsto initiate members of the society into different stages of social, cultural, religious, physical and natural transformations. (Kyalo, 2013; Babarinde-Hall, 2018). Arnold van Gennep brought the significance of rituals of transition into limelight in his work, *The rite of passage* where he refers to performances to mark periods of transition of the social status of individual human beings as rite of passage. (Gennep, 1960). The performance of rite of passage is a common phenomenon in the Yoruba socio cultural space. (Akinsipe & Babarinde-Hall, 2018) note that the entire Yoruba people's lives are shrouded in series of rites, especially that of birth, marriage and death. As noted above, rite of passage describes milestones of life, such as birth, maturity, marriage, reproduction and death, which are marked with rituals. Apart from the natural trajectory of the lifespan of human beings, rites of passage is also a social marker to herald transition from one level to another in social, religious, political, etc., stages and events in the lifetime of a person. According to (Gennep, 1960), rite of passage is a social custom used to mark specific moments of life course. He describes it as the celebration of some socio cultural milestones involving social changes such as birth, maturity (a biological change, such as a girl's first menstruation or genital cutting for men),  40 Print ISSN: ISSN 2056-5771(Print)  Online ISSN: ISSN 2056-578X (Online) marriage, reproduction and death, which are marked with rituals. (Cummings & McGarry, 2016, p. 61) describe rite of passage as 'a ritual signifying a person's passage from one identity to the next\". (Gennep, 1960) offers tripartite structure of the rite of passage involving three sequential stages/phases: pre liminal (separation), liminal (transition) and post liminal (incorporation). The pre liminal or the separation phase, according to Gennep, is when partakers (the initiates) consciously detach from old status, identity, environment, etc., focusing on the fact that a new status, identity, environment will soon be assumed. (Turner, 1969, p. 80) notes that this phase contains symbolic behaviours signifying the detachment of initiates from 'an earlier fixed point in social structure'. He notes that in between the pre liminal and post-liminal stages, there is the intermediate phase, the liminal zone from the Latin word *limen*, which means 'threshold', where the initiate is separated from the old but, yet to fully integrate to the new status. This is a phase marking the period between the past and the future: the threshold that binds the old with the future, which the initiator has to transit in order to shed the old (past) for the new (future). This stage, (Turner, 1969) describes as the marginal status \"between and betwixt\" the former status and the future. The third and final stage in the rite of passage, according to Gennep is the post liminal or incorporation, and it involves the integration of the initiate into a new social group. At this last stage, the initiator is fully incorporated into the new life, role and status. These cultural performances and rituals are semiotics markers of the rite of passage, an archetype of the initiate's negotiations of path between old and new social identities. It is on this note that this work looks at marriage, a status-changing marker, as a rite of passage, examining the communicative elements deployed in the Yoruba marriage rituals as semiotics resources in its process. It looks at the import of the communicative signs, which mirror the realities of the marriage institution, and which assists a bride through the pre liminal, liminal and post liminal stages of her rite of passage.  ## Significance Of The Study  Marriage as a ritual of the rite of passage cuts across all nations of the world; its celebration differs as the cultural diversities of its performers. In Africa, especially the Yoruba social cultural semiosphere, marriage is regarded as a sacred institution, therefore, solid foundation, based on traditional ethics and values attached to it must be deployed in all the processes of the ritual in other to internalise its values and ethics in the sub consciousness of the initiates. The spate of marriage crisis across the world is alarming, with couples walking in and out of marriage freely. This is largely because the core values of the yore have been eroded through distortions in the processes of marriage rituals in the modern day marriage ceremonies. It is on this note that this work explores and brings to the fore, the Yoruba traditional marriage rite to examine the linguistic and non-linguistic elements used in its processes as semiotics markers of the core Yoruba traditional values, which if eternalised by a bride, will guide and sustain her through and beyond marriage ceremony.

Social semiotics has enjoyed scholarly attention in social sciences and humanities; its preoccupation being the study of meaning making as a social practice. It looks at the significations of specific human practices or activities in certain social and cultural circumstances that are capable of construing meaning. (Thibault, 1991) notes that social semiotics is concerned with the development of analytical and theoretical frameworks, which can explain meaning making in a social context. (Hodge & Kress, 1988) state that the interest of social semiotics includes making meaning out of the study text, how people design and interpret, and how semiotics systems are shaped by social interest and ideologies. This theoretical framework is used in this study to look at the communicative elements deployed in the Yoruba traditional marriage processes as semiotics signs with social imports.  ## Research Methodology  The data used in this work is a Yoruba music drama by Chief Dr. Sulaiman Ayilara Aremu Ajobiewe titled *Asa Igbeyawo*,",

The music drama is considered an adequate text for this work because it provides profound insight into all the processes involved in the Yoruba traditional marriage from courtship, introduction, and engagement to post marriage existence. Though rendered in Yoruba language, it is subtitled in English, which helps in giving the text a universal outlook. The video was watched over a period after which the identified communicative elements - linguistic and non-linguistic - that give significations to the marriage ritual as a rite of passage were transcribed. Also, visuals depicting actions, expressions, emotions, etc. were captured through screenshot and used as illustrations in synergy with the linguistic elements, to further reveal the import of the communicative signs in the Yoruba traditional marriage's rite of passage. In addition to this, available scholarly materials on the Yoruba traditional marriage and my residual experience as a Yoruba woman further give insight to the concept of marriage as a rite of passage using the core Yoruba socio cultural view of marriage and marriage values. This study adopts qualitative research technique to critically analyse and interpret the linguistic (words, phrases, and sentences) and non-linguistics (pictorials, facial expressions, emotions) elements in the music drama deployed as semiotics resources, from social and cultural semiotics perspectives. Even though, the verbal semiotics resources used in the music drama were   Print ISSN: ISSN 2056-5771(Print)  Online ISSN: ISSN 2056-578X (Online) transcribed in Yoruba language, the inclusion of their English subtitles in the analysis provides fuller understanding of the message of the music drama.  ## Analysis  The aim of this study is to observe marriage as a rite of passage, identify the communicative elements in the text data as semiotics resources and discuss the signification of the identified semiotics elements as sign carriage of the transitional vehicles of the rite of passage embedded in the Yoruba traditional marriage. These aims and objectives form the basis of the analysis below.  ## Marriage As A Rite Of Passage  The Yoruba traditional marriage system fits into Gennep's description of the three phases of the rite of passage, and places marriage, firmly, as a rite of passage; an archetypal of the initiate's transition from one status to another. Marriage is a social contract involving two adults who decide to live together as husband and wife. It is a rite of passage, particularly, for the bride, who, by the singular act of marriage would undergo social and physiological changes. A young woman undergoes the three stages of Gennep's rites of passage in the Yoruba traditional marriage processes through courtship, engagement, wedding and the assumption of full marriage status as a wife, homemaker and mother. The courtship and introduction stages of the Yoruba traditional marriage mark the liminal stage where the young woman becomes conscious of her imminent new identity. This process separates her from being a single, unattached free young woman to a woman in a relationship, betrothed to be married. According to (Kyalo, 2013, p.46), rituals help us individually and communally to make sense of life's transitions, providing some structure to ease movement from the familiar to the unknown. In the Yoruba traditional marriage ritual, the liminal stage is marked with communicative elements depicting counselling, tutelage, prayers, etc., which help the young woman to prepare adequately for her imminent detachment before the final marriage ceremony.   At the marriage ceremony, the bride experiences the second and the most important phase of the rite of passage. This stage is described by Gennep as the \"threshold zone\" where the bride has to leave her old identity as a single woman for a new official status as a married woman. This is the liminal stage where she has to cross the threshold of her parents, families and friends to that of her husband and his family. For the bride, it is the most emotional phase of the rite of passage, a point when she has lost her old identity but not fully incorporated into the new one. This is the point at which, according to (Turner, 1967), the initiate is between one status and another. The post liminal or incorporation stage is the consolidation phase, which Gennep describes as the stage when the bride becomes a wife, properly married and faces the reality of marriage and the attendant responsibilities, roles and challenges. In this third phase, the passage is \"consummated by the ritual subject\" (Turner, 1969, p. 80). The phase starts with the consummation of the marriage and continues in a long journey of pregnancy, motherhood, etc. fully incorporated and ready to take attendant roles as a wife, a mother, a caregiver, etc. This is a learning curve where she has to   Print ISSN: ISSN 2056-5771(Print)  Online ISSN: ISSN 2056-578X (Online) deploy all the experiences and tutelage garnered from the semiotics resources deployed during the marriages processes to sustain and make a success of her new status. The Significations of the **Communicative Elements of the Yoruba Traditional Marriage** Semiotics as a tool of interpretation of social practices places the process of traditional marriage in the Yoruba socio cultural setting as a sign of influence, initiate and change. (Subasinghe, 2012, p.144) notes that signs are the guide of every behaviour and every behaviour can be considered a sign. This shows that a gamut of language in a text can be regarded as sign if it is recognized as something that can influence, initiate and cause changes. (van Leeuwen's, 2005, p.4) description of the whole gamut of communication, verbal or nonverbal, as semiotics resources deplored as sign making elements in social event is apt here, as the import of language is derived from the social context, which lends meaning to its usage. Therefore, language has to be situated in a particular context in order to make it a system of meaning that can effectively interpret a social event. It is, therefore, important to look at the semiotics imports of the elements of communication, both verbal and nonverbal, deployed as signs of the vehicle of transition in the Yoruba traditional marriage, which assist the bride at the preliminal, liminal and post liminal phases of her rite of passage. According to (van Leeuwen, 2005, p. 285), semiotics resources have meaning potentials, based on their past uses, and a set of affordances based on their possible uses, and these will be actualized in concrete social contexts where their use is subject to some form of semiotics regimes. These semiotics resources, which include words, phrases, sentences (used for prayers, admonition, etc.), and the non-verbal elements such as facial expressions, body language, emotions, etc., are meaning making resources with interpretative significance hinged on concrete and recognisable social affordances in the social context in which they are deployed for communication. The social context and shared background knowledge of the semiotics regime deployed in the music drama used as data in this work create synergy of communication among the protagonists, thereby making the internalisation of the interpretative elements mutually effective among them. Linguistic and non-linguistic elements deployed for communication in the Yoruba traditional marriage, as shown in Ajobiewe's music drama, are semiotics resources explicating the belief, values, social tones, and traditional norms of its people. The combination of the linguistic and nonlinguistic elements gives force to the signification of the entire process of meaning making, assisting in the encoding, decoding and simulating adequate responses among all involved in the communicating process with shared social, cultural and linguistic knowledge. The communicative elements deployed in the Yoruba traditional marriage ceremony are, therefore, signs that effectively give import to the intentions of speakers in the communication process.

Print ISSN: ISSN 2056-5771(Print)  Online ISSN: ISSN 2056-578X (Online)  ## The Pre Liminal Stage  This is the stage where a young woman is prepared as a future wife, mother, homemaker, caregiver, etc. through the marriage processes of courtship and introduction. In the music drama used as data in this work, Ajobiewe deployed linguistics elements with semiotics imports. Each statement identified in the text are massage carrying signs, signifying the core values of the Yoruba institution of marriage as it affects the woman, which adequately prepares her through the marriage's rite of passage. These linguistic elements are interchanges between the parents and their daughter, which facilitates filial understanding and bond that make tutelage, advice and admonition easy, understandable, and divine. At the preliminal stage, the linguistic elements deployed are sign carriage phrases and sentences signifying the core value of discipline and dignity expected of the Yoruba woman. Culturally, obirin alalubarika (a responsible woman) is not expected to engage in an unguarded relationship. She is not expected to mingle freely with her prospective suitor but insist her hands must be properly sought in marriage. According to Ajobiewe in the music drama: \"Obinrin alalubarika, bi okunrin ba baa soro ni'ta, a ni e ka jo de'le wa. A ni ko wa lo mon awon obi mi\" **Yoruba** \"A responsible lady, when she's approached outside, she'll invite the fellow to come and meet her parents\" **English** subtitle The allusion to the *alarina* concept in the music drama shows the importance of courtship in the Yoruba traditional marriage value system. Courtship is a very important stage where the *alarina* (the-go-between man or the mediator) plays significant role in facilitating the relationship between two adults in love relationship. The suitor is not supposed to have free access to her betrothal, except through the *alarina* who facilitates the relationship between them. Stressing the alarina concept, Ajobiewe notes: \"Laye 'josi bi a ba fe fe'yawo, won ma n'lalarena logiri\u2026\" **Yoruba** \"*In those days when we intend to marry a wife, there was always a mediator\".* **English subtitle** \"Afi'gba taya ba moju oko tan, ohun lalarena nyeba.\" **Yoruba** \"*It is only when the lady is satisfied with her suitor that the that the mediator leaves the scene* **English subtitle** The linguistic words and phrases deployed in the data used in this work are very significant in explicating the core traditional values of the Yoruba people about marriage that guide the bride through her rite of passage. They are the Yoruba inherent linguistic concepts needed in marriage process to indoctrinate a woman into the traditional Yoruba moral values of respect of dignity, which expectedly she would pass to her children later in life. The concept of dignity of a woman is further stressed in the music drama by the use of the phrase *nisu loka*, meaning \"following through the right process\".   \"Wa so fawon obi re pe ki won o wale; ki won wa fe mi nisu loka naa ni\" **Yoruba** \"Tell your parents to come and marry me properly **English subtitle** To marry a woman *nisu loka* (properly) as translated above means the fulfilment of all that is traditionally required by the groom's parents to the parents and family of the bride. In the Yoruba traditional core values precept, marriage is between two families: that of the bride and the groom.   45 Print ISSN: ISSN 2056-5771(Print)  Online ISSN: ISSN 2056-578X (Online) The woman is assumed to be married to her prospective husband once the family of the man visit hers and the two families agree that their children could get married. She is still in her parents' house, though, but betrothed to a man. She has fulfilled the first quality by behaving responsibly, taking the bold step of informing her suitor to bring his parents to her home and do the needful. After the introduction, which is usually a private meeting between the two parents and few selected family members done in the house of the bride to be, the young woman is separated mentally from being an unmarried woman, preparing towards the formal nuptial knot. The separation stage begins here. The woman is betrothed. She is still in her parents' house but she is aware she is no longer a free woman. The signification of the introduction ceremony in the Yoruba traditional marriage process is the mental separation of the bride, representing the pre liminal stage of the rite of passage. The communicative elements at this stage are vehicular carriages that assist the young woman to prepare her mind for the liminal stage of the rite of passage. The import of these communicative elements is further reinforced by the combination of visual and linguistic elements through subtitling. Subtitles are translations of dialogue in a video, which usually appear as text at the base of the screen and give viewers a good insight into the content of a video item. According to (Zanon, 2006, p. 43), a subtitled video provides a triple connection between image, sound in one language and text, normally in another, sound and text being typically linked by translation. Subtitle becomes a good visual device enhancing the meaning of the content of the Yoruba music drama because of the \"fleeting nature\" of verbal communication. (Mahmud, ![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png) The Liminal Stage In the Yoruba traditional setting, the major or official marriage process is the traditional marriage, a covenant stage where the two families come together in the open to seal the love relationship of their children in the presence of friends, families and well-wishers. This is the liminal stage where   Print ISSN: ISSN 2056-5771(Print)  Online ISSN: ISSN 2056-578X (Online) the woman crosses the Rubicon. She takes another status as a married woman ready to leave her parents, friends and family to that of her husband. It is a formal stage with all semiotics elements signifying the liminal stage of the marriage rite of passage. Ajobiewe engages linguistic and visual items in the music drama as signs with cultural significations. (Berger, 2010, p. 3) describes sign as the \"unity of word-object known as signifier with a corresponding culturally prescribed content or meaning known as a signified.\" The linguistic elements deployed as signs at this stage are symbolic words with cultural connotations. The items such as *ogede* (plantain), isu (yam), *orogbo* (bitter cola), obi (kolanut), *ireke* (sugarcane), iyo (salt), *oyin* (honey), etc., used as prayer items in the Yoruba traditional marriage are semiotics signs with word-object unity, relevant as effective transitional vehicles in the rite of passage. They are linguistic elements with peculiar common system of reference that give the Yoruba marriage culture its uniqueness. They have socially and culturally accepted interpretations different from, or in addition to the denotational or literary meaning across the globe. O*gede, isu,* orogbo, obi, ireke, iyo, oyin, etc are signs carriage items with peculiar attributes that give signification to the content and context of the Yoruba traditional marriage ceremony as prayer items. Using Pierce triadic theory of sign, (Ogunkunle, 2013, pp. 1106-7) views the items of prayers in the Yoruba traditional marriage from three perspectives: the quality, the association signs with the object of sign and their cultural implications. He notes that the attributes of the signs used are the particular qualities associated with the signifiers and that are found useful for the joining process in marriage. In Yoruba land, the sign objects are intentionally deployed in marriage and naming ceremonies because of specific relevant qualities and peculiarities deducible from the objects, which make them relevant prayer items for the occasions. Thus, (Danessi, 2004, p.16) affirms that the intent of the form maker, the historical and social contexts in which the",

        "sentence_chunk": "representation was made, the purpose for which it was made, are all intertwined in signs interpretation. (Danessi, 2004, p. 17) notes further that the type of representamen used to portray the object also shapes the meaning. Iconically, these items are edibles, but symbolically, they represent fertility, longevity, preventions, sweetness, fruitfulness, etc.; the qualities that make them adequate prayer items, with cultural imports and significations to the marriage ceremony, as items of prayer, most needed by the bride at the liminal stage and beyond. Ajobiewe deploys the combination of linguistic and visual elements to show the importance of prayer as one of the vehicles of transition in the rite of passage showing the sign carrying component of the prayer through visualisation of the prayer items as shown in fig. 2 below:  Print ISSN: ISSN 2056-5771(Print)  Online ISSN: ISSN 2056-578X (Online)  ![8_image_0.png](8_image_0.png)  In the Yoruba socio cultural setting, it is believed that the profit of marriage are the children harvested from it. Importance, is therefore, placed on fruitfulness of marriage through child bearing. *Ogede* (banana) and isu (yam) as used in the music drama are sign nodes of fruitfulness of marriage.  \"Ogede ki ngbodo ko ya'gan\". **Yoruba** \"The banana is never barren\" **English Subtitle** \"Won a ni isu omo a jina fun yin je\" **Yoruba** \"*They'll say yam stands for reaping the benefit of your children\"* **English Subtitle** Marriage is associated with sweetness, and it is the desire of parents that their daughter enjoy the sweetness of marriage. Analogy is drawn between *oyin* (honey) and iyo (salt) as prayer items and their sweetness to pray for the bride to enjoy the sweet savory of married life.   \"Olorun oba je kaye yin o loyin, ko ladun gidi ni\" **Yoruba** \"*God will add honey and sweetness to your life\"* **English Subtitle** \"Kaye yin tun wa lo n'iyo gidi ni\" **Yoruba** \"May the life be filled with salt\" **English Subtitle** After the prayers, which is very important as a vehicle of transition in the Yoruba marriage rite of passage, the bride is pronounced married. This is the liminal stage, the point where she crosses the Rubicon, and sheds her past status to take a new one. Ajobiewe recounts in the music drama:  \"E ti wa gba'dua, ree. Iwo Iyawo, ki o wa gbera n'le o dide, o dile oko\" **Yoruba** \"You've now be prayed for. The bride, get up now and proceed to your husband's house\" **English Subtitle** Ajobiewe continues in the music drama to use linguistic items with cultural significance peculiar to the Yoruba socio cultural setting. The concept of ori (head) in the Yoruba socio-cultural belief as shown in the music drama is worthy of note for its semiotics import. The perception of ori in the Yoruba traditional belief goes beyond its physiological categorisation as part of the body. It is 48 Print ISSN: ISSN 2056-5771(Print)  Online ISSN: ISSN 2056-578X (Online) seen as the 'source of life and the essence of human personality (Idowu, 1970, pp. 170-75; Abimbola, 1971, pp. 73-89). Ori (head), in the Yoruba socio cultural setting is a culturally conditioned semiotics sign, indicating destiny, luck, personal spirit being, guiding angel, etc. Ori (the Spiritual/inner head, which is the destiny conveyor) is the third of the tripartite conception of a human being in the Yoruba belief: the first and second being *ara* (body) and *emi* (soul). (Hallen & Sodipo, 1986, p. 105). The Yorubas believe that the head directs the course of life of human beings. It is the personal god that is responsible for the security of the bearer (Abimbola, 1976, p. 132; Balogun 2007, p. 119). The bride's head is the guiding angel that will direct her course, keep her marriage and attract luck to her in marriage. (Balogun, 2007, p. 118) echoes (Idowu, 1962) assertion that ori is not only the bearer of destiny but also, the essence of human personality, which rules, control and guides the life and activities of the person. The bride covets the protection and guidance of her mother's head as she proceeds in her matrimonial journey. In the music drama, she says:  \"Ori ni nsinni dele oko, iwa ni nsinni de'po to ga o, iya mi jojolo eni **k'ori** *yin sin mi de'bi ijoko mi\"* **Yoruba**  \"It's one's head that goes with her to the husband's house, while one's character takes her to higher level, my tender mother, ask your **head** *to escort me to my matrimonial home\"* **English Subtitle** Ajobiewe lays emphasis on the import of the head as iconic and symbolic elements of communication in the Yoruba traditional marriage through the combination of linguistic and nonlinguistic elements in the music drama. The bride's mother, therefore, appeals to her daughter not to let off her guard but be spiritually connected to her ori (spiritual guardians), which she needs more than her physical look (beauty) to make a success of her marriage. Admonishing her, her mother says: \"Oko mi, Arike, dakun mori lo, ma ma mewa lo\" **Yoruba** \"*My daughter, Arike, go with your head, held high and not your beauty\"* **English Subtitle** There is synergy of sign usage and interpretation of the lexical items by the protagonists who share mutual cultural and social backgrounds of the linguistic elements; therefore, their usage gives the desired interpretation and draws the appropriate reaction. The head is a guidance, an arbiter, a protector, etc. which the bride needs in the course of her journey. This triggers reaction from her mother who holds her head while praying for her daughter, the bride. In addition, she is seen touching the head of the bride (her daughter) while praying for her. See fig 3.  ![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)  Print ISSN: ISSN 2056-5771(Print)  Online ISSN: ISSN 2056-578X (Online) The liminal stage is the most complex of the three stages of the ritual of rites of passage in marriage. It is a stage of parting, of prayer, and of mixed emotions of fear, nostalgic, expectations and assurances. The bride solicits the much-needed prayers amidst tears, from her parents just before crossing the Rubicon. This is the most emotional aspect of the marriage rite and the emotional vehicle that carries her across the two lines of her old status as a young unmarried woman and a new status as a married woman. She communicates her inner feelings amidst overwhelming tears, which (Raji & Ajadi, 2013, p. 144) describes as *ekun Iyawo* (bridal chant) in the Yoruba traditional wedding arrangement. In social context, signs as objects may mean more than the general interpretation. For instance, tears gives emotions signals such as sadness, horror, bereavement, etc. but it could also be a sign of joy. The bridal chant brings an emotionally induced tears from the woman who feels nostalgic leaving her parents, yet happy and fulfilled becoming a ![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png) The Post Liminal Stage As affirmed by Gennep, the liminal stage is a phase between the preliminal and post liminal stages. Ajobiewe dramatically mirrors the post liminal stage in the liminal with semiotics signs reflecting the post liminal stage as the bride crosses the Rubicon and faces reality of life. The linguistic elements that features at this stage are sign carriage modes explicating the core values of the Yorubas about the role of a woman as a wife, mother and caregiver who is expected to be loyal, respectful and persevere. She must accord her husband respect as the head of the family. The brides father admonishes the bride to respect her husband: \"Koo ranti pe oko lolo'wo ori aya\" **Yoruba** \"*Remember the husband is the head of the wife\"* **English Subtitle** She is advised and warned against promiscuity; she must be loyal to her husband.  \"Dakun, du'o na, diedie ni oo maa se foko, mase se oju meji lodo oko.\" **Yoruba** \"Please, respect your husband and shun promiscuity.\" **English Subtitle** Perseverance as a virtue in marriage is impressed on the bride as she goes to her matrimonial house. Ajobiewe affirms that it is only through perseverance that a woman enjoys matrimony. He says: \"Bo ba nsowipe, odo'goji odun, ogota odun ti mo ti wa nile oko. Oo mo wipe ninu aforiti naa ni. Yoruba",

This is a most needed transition vehicle in the rite of passage to give the bride the needed courage and hope for a brighter and enjoyable matrimonial life.  \"Ile oko re dun oya maa lo, iyawo **Yoruba** \"Your husband's house is sweet, please, go there: the bride\" *English Subtitle*  ## Conclusion  The Yoruba traditional marriage rites deploys linguistic elements, aided by nonlinguistic ones such as body language, facial expression, mood, etc. as meaning making process in the Yoruba traditional marriage social context. The central theme of this study is the examination the elements of communication deployed in the Yoruba traditional marriage ritual that are significations of the process of transition of a young woman from spinsterhood to a married woman. The identified communicative elements are well organized to allow ease of meaning making among the interlocutors in the communicative chain. The interlocutors have similar language, expectations, cultural and social definitions which enhance effective communicate and meaning making in the communication process. This gives room for effective encoding and responses by the principal characters: the father, mother, daughter and other participants in the music drama used as data in this work, bringing to bear their mutual knowledge and shared experience in information dissemination and processing. All the elements mentioned above are social resources, which their significations are both perfectly convincing to the participants as language interpretation signs and important ingredients of successful marriage. It is noted that some of the statements draw emotions such as admiration, nostalgic, reminiscence, etc. from the participants as shown in their facial expressions, postures, emotions, etc.  The processes of the Yoruba traditional marriage ritual reveal the belief and value of the Yoruba people about marriage, especially on the preparation of a young woman for marriage. The success or other wise of a woman's marriage tells a lot about the level of home discipline and the Yoruba traditional values she is able to learn from her home; therefore, the various processes of the rite of passage of the Yoruba woman, involving tutelage, admonitions, prayers, encouragement, etc. are to prepare her for marriage. It is noted that the contemporary marriage setting has neglected the traditional processes, which prepare the woman adequately, not only as a woman, but also a well-cultured wife, mother, caregiver and good representative of her family. This work intends to bring to the fore, the significant of the Yoruba traditional marriage ritual as shown in the body of this work as a way of adequately preparing a woman physically and psychologically towards a successful marriage. It is believed that if the traditional ways of communicating values and precepts to the bride during the traditional marriage rituals in the olden days are encouraged and reintroduced into the 51 Print ISSN: ISSN 2056-5771(Print)  Online ISSN: ISSN 2056-578X (Online) contemporary marriage ceremony arrangement, it will go a long way in curbing the increasing divorce cases and marriage related crises in the society.  ## References  Abimbola, W.
