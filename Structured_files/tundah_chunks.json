Hence section 3 of the Marriage Act1 provides that: \"(1) Marriage is the voluntary union of a man and a woman whether in a monogamous or polygamous union and registered in accordance with this Act. (2) Parties to a marriage have equal rights and obligations at the time of the marriage, during the marriage and at the dissolution of the marriage. (3) All marriages registered under this Act have the same legal status. (4) Subject to sub-section (2), the parties to an Islamic marriage shall only have the rights granted under Islamic law.\" The Marriage Act accommodates Islamic law relating to marriage and divorce.  Thus section 49(3) of the Act provides that \"[a]ny provision of this Act which is inconsistent with Islamic law and practices shall not apply to persons who profess the Islamic faith.\" Under the Islamic law of inheritance, as a general rule, a woman's share is half of that of a man, children born out of wedlock and non-Muslims do not inherit from their father or from any Muslim respectively. Case law from Kenyan courts, including the Khadi's Court, shows that these rules have raised",

The discussion also shows that Islamic law is of the same legal force as Kenyan legislation on marriage and inheritance. However, it, as with any other law in Kenya, has to be applied in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The purpose of this article is to assess this jurisprudence on the issues of marriage and inheritance and highlight some of the contentious issues dealt with by the courts. It is argued that the Court of Appeal's decision in CKC & another (Suing through their mother and next friend JWN) v ANC, 2 in which it held that a child born out wedlock could inherit from his/her Muslim father, is questionable, and that although a Muslim has freedom of testation, his/her will has to comply with Islamic law for it to be valid.  The author will first discuss the jurisprudence from Kenyan courts on the issue of Islamic marriages before discussing the jurisprudence on inheritance. This is important because many of the cases on inheritance arise from the legality or otherwise of a marriage. Before discussing the jurisprudence emanating from Kenyan courts on the issues of Muslim marriages and inheritance, the author will briefly deal with the jurisdiction of Kadhi's Courts.  ## Jurisdiction Of The Kadhi'S Court  Article 170(1) of the Constitution establishes the Kadhi's courts.3 A Kadhi's Court is one of the subordinate courts4 and is supervised by the High Court.5 Article 170(5) provides that \"[t]he",

In HA v AH, 8 the High Court referred to article 170(5) of the Constitution and held that \"[t]he 3 factors on jurisdiction of the Kadhi's Court are not disjunctive but conjunctive. They must all exist together for the Court to have jurisdiction. Where they do not, the Kadhi's Court is stripped of jurisdiction.\"9 It is therefore a pre-condition that both parties agree that the matter should be referred to the Kadhi's Court10 and that they must be Muslims.11 For the Kadhi's Court to exercise jurisdiction in issues of marriage, the parties must \"profess the Muslim religion\". Courts have understood this phrase to mean that the parties are Muslim. This raises the question of whether the Kadhi's Court has jurisdiction in cases in which a Muslim man has married a non-Muslim woman. In Ramadhan Mustafa v Zulfa Ngasia Juma, 12 the High Court held that: \"Quran, chapter 2 Al-Baqara verse 221, there is spelt out prohibition of marriage between Muslims and persons of other religious faiths, the exception however allows Muslim men to marry women of the beliefs i.e. Jews and Christians as provided under chapter 5 verse 5.\"13 The Court of Appeal held that a",

Section 6(3) provides that \"[a] marriage celebrated under \u2026 Islamic law is presumed to be polygamous or potentially polygamous.\" The High Court held that \"Muslims [sic] marriage like the English marriage is a contract but it is a special contract involving, as it does, strong interpersonal relationship between the bride and the bridegroom. It is not an economic transaction.\"25 Kenyan courts have dealt with the question of the validity of a Muslim marriage. This is important before a marriage can be registered. The discussion that follows deals with issues that courts have highlighted which relate to the validity of a Muslim marriage. In SMK v RHH, 26 the Kadhi's Court held that: \"Marriage under Islamic law is classified as: (1) valid, (2) void, and (3) irregular.  According to [an] eminent Jurist, the classification is as follows: (a) lawful - that is, a marriage which is contracted in compliance with all legal requirements; (b) unlawful - that is, a marriage which has been solemnized in violation of one or another legal requirement; (c) void - that is, a marriage which, though claimed to have been solemnized, has no legal recognition at all; and (d) irregular - that is, a marriage which is unlawful but not void.\"27 In the above",

Hence the High Court held that: \"The legislation on Mohammedan [Muslim] marriages does not contain any substantive provisions on the rights of the parties with respect to [those marriages]. These rights are governed by the Koran and the legal rules applicable to the particular sect to which the parties belong. The courts depend on Islamic scholars and Islamic scholastic works on the content of Islamic marriages.\"31 Thus, the starting point when one is dealing with the rights of parties to a Muslim marriage is the Quran. After that, a court will refer to the rules of the relevant Islamic sect. Therefore, the rights of parties in a Muslim marriage partly depend on the rules of a particular sect. The Kadhi's Court has explained some of these rights. For example, it held that \"[t]he sharia has given a right to the husband to retain a hold on his wife in return whereof it is obligatory on him to provide maintenance to her.\"32 Both parties have conjugal rights33 and should not be cruel towards each other.34  ##",

InIn re Estate of Ramadhan Hassan(Deceased)36 the Kadhi's Court held that: \"The question whether there was a marriage or not is one of fact \u2026 [M]arriage may be proved directly or presumptively; directly by means of the oral testimony of the witnesses present at the marriage or by documentary evidence in the shape of a certificate of marriage signed by both parties and their witnesses; presumptively by statement of parties or by evidence of conduct and reputation.\"37 The High Court held that \"[w]hat constitutes an Islamic marriage is \u2026 a matter of fact to be proved strictly.\"38 In NNS v SAM, 39 the High Court held that a \"marriage certificate is enough proof of\" the fact that the parties celebrated their marriage according to Islamic law.40 Although a marriage certificate \"is recommended\", its non-existence does not invalidate a Muslim marriage.41 The Kadhi's Court held that the purpose of a marriage certificate is \"to remove disputes\".  42 Apart from a marriage certificate, there are other ways in which one can prove that a Muslim marriage took place. These other ways have included producing the notes of the Kadhi who solemnized the marriage and calling witnesses to testify that the marriage was celebrated and the dowry was paid.43 Some Muslim scholars argue that the mere fact that there were no witnesses to",

However, as the discussion below illustrates, in Islamic law some of these conditions are not a prerequisite for the validity of a marriage between people who profess the Islamic faith (both parties are Muslim) or a marriage between a Muslim man and a non-Muslim woman. Section 48 of the Marriage Act regulates marriages between \"persons who profess the Islamic faith\".  46 Both the High Court and the Kadhi's Court held that section 48 \"provides for Islamic Marriages\".  47 Section 49 provides that such a marriage has to be \"officiated by a kadhi, sheikh or imam as may be authorised by the Registrar and celebrated in accordance with Islamic law\". Under section 6(3) of the Marriage Act, customary marriages and marriages celebrated according to Islamic law are polygamous or presumed to be polygamous. Section 8 of the Act provides for circumstances in which a marriage may be converted from a polygamous one to a monogamous one. It is to the effect that: \"(1) A marriage may be converted from being a potentially polygamous marriage to a monogamous marriage if each spouse voluntarily declares the intent to make such a conversion. (2) A polygamous marriage",

Both these types of marriage are polygamous, or potentially polygamous, but they are governed by different rules and parties are entitled to different rights.48 This is an issue that the High Court and the Court of Appeal have dealt with, as the discussion below illustrates. When a person converts from Christianity to Islam and conducts a marriage according to Islamic law, such a marriage is governed by Islamic law. However, if parties conducted their marriage according to customary law before converting to Islam, their conversion to Islam does not automatically change their marriage from a customary one to a Muslim one; they are supposed to convert it into an Islamic marriage. As the High Court held in RMM v M a.k.a. JKM.  49 \"The parties herein converted to the Islamic faith in 1994 eight years after entering into a marriage under Kamba customary law. There was no evidence adduced of conversion of the marriage into an Islamic law marriage as there was no ceremony performed as required by Section 49(1) of the Marriage Act, 2014.\"50  ## The Court Added That:  \"In order for a marriage conducted under whichever [regime] to be valid, it should meet the legal requirements provided by the Marriage Act.\u2026 Change of religion does not of itself convert a marriage to the new religion. The parties must take steps to ensure",

        "sentence_chunk": "the law is complied with. Converting a marriage from one type to another is a legal process. It cannot be equated to change of religion where a word of mouth is sufficient evidence of conversion.\"51 If the marriage is not \"re-celebrated under the couple's newfound faith\", it \"remained a customary one subject to the laws governing marriages contracted under customary law\".  52 In coming to this conclusion, the High Court referred to section 49(1) of the Act. This implies that people who convert to Islam after having celebrated a customary marriage also have to ensure that they perform a ceremony to change their marriage from a customary one to a Muslim one. Therefore, their marriage would now have to be presided over by one of the people mentioned under section 49(1) of the Act. However, the Court of Appeal and the High Court's conclusions on this issue are not supported by Islamic law. According to Islamic law, when a couple converts to Islam, they keep their marriage contract and their marriage automatically becomes a Muslim marriage.53 Therefore, in the event of a divorce, such a marriage is governed by Islamic law.  Neither the Marriage Act nor the Kadhis' Courts Act stipulates the conditions for a valid Muslim marriage. However, a close examination of case law reveals these conditions. In RWK v AMA54 the Kadhi's Court, based on a textbook on Islamic law, gave some of the conditions of a valid marriage: the parties must be of sound mind, they must have attained the age of marriage, and they must consent to",

Section 49(1) of the Marriage Act provides for people who are allowed to officiate at Islamic marriages. Another requirement is that the groom has to pay a dowry to the bride. The dowry aspect of the marriage has to be dealt with in accordance with Islamic law and not in accordance with customary law.59 The mention of the amount of the dowry at the time of the nikkah [marriage] is not a prerequisite for the validity of a marriage.60 There is a difference between dowry and bride price. The High Court held in FBI v BG that61 \"'[B]ride price' and 'dowry' are two different things, though the two have often been confused to mean the same thing. Bride price is a gift or payment made to the parents of the bride at marriage, while dowry is a gift given to the woman in a marriage, which becomes her sole property. The promise of dowry in the marriage is a contract and in my view is enforceable.\"62 Another requirement is that the \"consent of guardian [waliyy] is a condition to the validity of any marriage.

The High Court held that \"[t]he only provisions of the Act that are applicable to the estate of the Muslim as per Section 2(4) are the procedural provisions contained in Part VII of the Act relating to administration of estates.\"77 In other words, \"substantive provisions of the Act are not applicable to testamentary or intestate succession to the estate of any person who at the time of his death is a Muslim\".  78 Since the Kadhis' Courts Act does not define the term \"estate\", the High Court has relied on the Succession Act for the definition of the term.79 The High Court held that: \"Under Islamic law",

This is because Allah legislated fixed shares for legal heirs.\"108 Where the deceased died intestate but made an affidavit in which he donated some of his property to a person, for example his child, the donation is valid but the remaining \"properties have to be distributed to the beneficiaries in accordance with Islamic Law of Inheritance\".  109 However, there is a limitation on the amount that the deceased is allowed to will-out, which is one-third of the estate. The rationale behind this is \"that the deceased must have some inheritance to the lawful heirs\".  110 In Fatuma Anab Mohamed Haji & 5 others v Asha Abdullahi & 3 others111 the High Court held, based on the submissions made by counsel for the parties, that: \"[T]here are three conditions under Islamic Law for making a gift before death on property.

In In the Matter of the Estate of Ishmael Juma Chelanga - Deceased118 the High Court held that: \"It is a fallacy on the part of many widows \u2026 to hold the view \u2026 that after the death of their husbands, they shall take possession of all immovable property left by them, under the false impression that they are the owners of everything.

In construing the will of the deceased, therefore, the pertinent question to ask is whether he would have happily contemplated to see his widow and life-time companion, whose care and protection was a solemn duty imposed upon him by the Quranic teachings, deprived of three quarters of his estate in favour of a cousin, a person presumably of independent means, and a person who has not been shown to have had, or likely to have, any",

In effect, the judgment shows that there are circumstances in which a Muslim man of a Shia sect can bequeath all his estate to his wife. This principle is likely to be contested by Sunni Muslims. This is so because the Chief Kadhi of Kenya had already invoked the principle of devolution or representation to hold that the appellant, the deceased's cousin, was entitled to two-thirds of the estate. If, for example, the husband helps the wife to build her house, such a house belongs to her and it does not form part of his estate that is distributed after his death.125  ## Human Rights Issues Arising From Islamic Law On Inheritance And Children  In this part of the article, the author deals with three issues that raise human rights questions in the context of inheritance.

In this case, there was evidence that the young children were dependent on their father before his death. The applicants referred to various regional and international human rights instruments which guarantee the right to equality.128 The Court held that the Constitution does not provide for an absolute right to equality and that Kenyan law allows Muslims to administer their estate in accordance with Islamic law.129 The Court emphasized that Islamic law was very clear that \"illegitimate\" children and non-Muslims do not inherit from a deceased Muslim.130 In dismissing the application, the Court reasoned that it was sympathetic to the children, but added that it: \"[M]ust fault the deceased and S [the children's mother].

He/she can only inherit from their mother.138 However, six months later, in the case of CKC & another (Suing through their mother and next friend JWN) v ANC, 139 the Court of Appeal reached a different conclusion - but the facts were different.

Secondly, in interpreting the Quran-inspired law, regard must be had to the Quran's moral teaching as a whole. Thirdly, Islamic law is dynamic and adapts to evolving social, political, cultural and economic conditions and realities and that \"not all rules of inheritance are rigidly fixed for all times since the development of Muslim jurisprudence has been and continues to be a search for the good law to be applied in differing times and situations.\" Lastly,\u2026 Islamic law does not constitute a single uniform code of law.

The starting point is to refer to section 2 of the Succession Act,150 which states that as a general rule the Succession Act does not apply to the estate of a deceased Muslim. The effect of section 2(3) of the Succession Act is to ensure that the estate of a deceased Muslim is governed by Islamic law. Islamic law provides the exact shares to which each beneficiary is entitled. A Muslim does not have a choice between having his estate dealt with in terms of the Islamic law or the Law of Succession Act. This is because section 2(3) makes it very clear and in mandatory terms that the estate of a Muslim \"shall be governed by Muslim law\". This is important because the word \"shall\" is used and means that it imposes a mandatory condition.  The problem with the Court of Appeal's reasoning is that it conflated two issues: the jurisdiction of the Kadhi's Court and the application of Islamic law to the estate of a deceased Muslim.

First, whether or not a non-Muslim will inherit from a Muslim will depend on the Islamic school of thought of the parties, as opposed to that of the presiding Kadhi. This is not an easy task in light of the fact that the Court of Appeal, in its earlier decision, referred to a statement from the International Islamic Conference to the effect that there are eight Islamic schools of jurisprudence.158 Although the \"Kenyan Islamic practice \u2026 is predominantly Sunni with a Shafi intellectual tradition\", 159 the Court of Appeal's ruling is likely to create a situation in which some people will resort to \"fatwa-shopping\", which means \"looking for a favourable fatwa\".  160 As Ricklefs explained, fatwa shopping is possible \"[s]ince there is a",

This is because a correct reading of section 5 of the Kadhis' Courts Act and article 170(5) of the Constitution shows that such courts have no jurisdiction over an issue unless both parties profess the Islamic faith and they submit to the court voluntarily. As a result, all inheritance matters that involve Muslims and non-Muslims will have to be handled by the High Court. However, the High Court would have to follow Muslim law when dealing with the estate of a deceased Muslim. This is so because, as mentioned above, section 2(3) of the Law of Succession Act provides that the estate of a Muslim \"shall be governed by Muslim law\".  164 The High Court held that \"[w] hile dealing with the estate of a deceased Muslim, this Court is required by Section 2(3) of the Act to apply Islamic law in the devolution of the estate.\"165 Depending on the Islamic school of thought adopted by the High Court and the",

In effect, the question of whether a non-Muslim can inherit from a Muslim is one to be decided according to Islamic law. One of the consequences of the Court of Appeal's judgment is that it is likely to affect all Kadhi's Court and High Court decisions in which these courts have found that non-Muslims cannot inherit from their Muslim parents or husbands. These decisions could easily be challenged.166 However, even Muslims have a right not to subject themselves to the jurisdiction of the Kadhi's Court, and in that case their dispute will be resolved by the High Court but based on Muslim law.167 It has been mentioned above that the Kadhi's Court and the High Court have held that under Islamic law, a child born out of wedlock cannot inherit from his father. This, as the Court of Appeal held, has a negative impact on the rights of the children.

This does not mean that such a right does not exist. Thus, section 5(1) of the Succession Act provides that \"\u2026 every person who is of sound mind and not a minor may dispose of all or any of his free property by will, and may thereby make any disposition by reference to any secular or religious law that he chooses\". Kenyan courts have emphasized that section 5 provides for the freedom of testation.182 Although in SKHS v SSNS183 the Court of Appeal did not find it necessary to address the issue of a whether a Muslim can make a valid secular will, it is argued that because section 5 of the Law of Succession Act does not form Part VII of the Act which is applicable to Muslims, a Muslim has to make a will that complies with Islamic law. If a Muslim makes a secular will, that will is invalid. In simple terms, as the High Court held in In Re Estate of James Karanja Alias James Kioi (Deceased), much as a person has freedom of testation, this freedom is not absolute and the court has to give effect to the wishes of the testator \"unless it is prevented by some rule of law from doing so\".  184 In the case of a deceased Muslim's estate, section 2(3) of the Succession Act read with the relevant principles of Islamic law limits the testator's freedom of testation by requiring it not to transgress",

The author has discussed, inter alia, the conditions which have to be met for a Muslim marriage to be valid, the principles governing inheritance and the human rights issues arising out of these principles. It has been argued further that the Court of Appeal's decision in CKC & another (Suing through their mother and next friend JWN) v ANC, in which it held that a child born out wedlock could inherit from his/her Muslim father, was partly wrongly decided. This is so because it conflates the issue of the jurisdiction of the Kadhi's Court with the application of the Succession Act to the estate of a deceased Muslim. The author also argues that although the Law of Succession Act and international human rights instruments provide for the right of testation, Kenyan law does not allow Muslims to make valid secular wills.  ## Conflicts Of Interest  None",

While recognizing the role of legislation in reform, it is argued that the courts have an important role to play in ensuring that customary law is reformed and developed to ensure that it conforms to human rights norms and contributes to the promotion of equality between men and women. The guiding principle should be that customary law is living law and cannot therefore be static. It must be interpreted to take account of the lived experiences of the people it serves.   ## Introduction  The national legal system of a typical African state is pluralistic and composed of the following sources African customary law: religious laws (especially where there is a significant Muslim population); received law (common law or civil law depending on the colonial history)1; and   legislation, both colonial (adopted from the colonial state) and postindependence legislation enacted by Parliament. Customary law is the indigenous law of the various ethnic groups of Africa. The pre-colonial law in most African states was essentially customary in character, having its sources in the practices and customs of the people.

There are local variations within such areas, but, by and large, the broad principles in all the various systems are the same. There is broad agreement that in its present form customary law is distorted. The sources of customary law that are historically and presently accepted as authoritative are a product of social conditions and political motivations. It is influenced by the recent interaction between African custom and colonial rule. In Alexkor Limited v. Richtersveld Community, the Constitutional Court of South Africa observed that \"although a number of text books exist and there is a considerable body of precedent, courts today have to bear in mind the extent to which indigenous law in the pre-democratic period was influenced by the political, administrative and judicial context in which it was applied.\"2 Customary law has a great impact on the lives of the majority of Africans in the area of personal law in regard to matters such as marriage, inheritance, and traditional authority.3 In its application, customary law is often discriminatory in such areas as bride price,   guardianship, inheritance, appointment to traditional offices, exercise of traditional authority, and age of majority.

Many African constitutions contain provisions guaranteeing equality, human dignity, and prohibiting discrimination based on gender. However, the same constitutions recognize the application of customary law and they do this without resolving the conflict between customary law norms and human rights provisions. Using Zambia's Constitution as an example, a typical constitution provision limits the application of provisions outlawing discrimination by providing that such provisions shall not apply to any law so far as that law makes provision: (a) for the appropriation of the general revenues of the Republic; (b) with respect to persons who are not citizens of Zambia; (c) with respect to adoption, marriage, divorce, burial, devolution of property on death or other matters of personal law; (d) for the application in the case of members of a particular race or tribe, of customary law with respect to",

Customary norms entrench ideas and help give them the sense of being natural and part of the way things are or should be. While African customary law emphasizes rights in the context of the community and kinship rights and duties of individuals to their communities, human rights norms typically enjoin state parties to treaties to respect human rights and take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women.6 Human rights norms proceed on the basis that women's rights under international conventions are universal norms to which all countries must adhere,7 women are entitled to the exercise of their human rights, and fundamental rights and fundamental freedoms within the family and society. Human rights norms also proceed on the basis that the protection of the family as a social unit should not be used to justify restrictions on the individual rights of family members.

In such a context, efforts to reform customary law can easily be interpreted as an effort to impose Western values on African societies. In defense of customary law, Cobbah exemplifies this reaction. He states that It is my contention that to correct injustices within different cultural systems of the world it is not necessary to turn all people into Westerners. Western liberalism with its prescription of human rights has had a worthwhile effect not only on Westerners but on many peoples of this world. It is, however, by no means the only rational way of living human life. . . . Instead of imposing the Western philosophy of human rights on all cultures one's effort should be directed to searching out homeomorphic equivalents in different cultures. In other words, we should understand that homeomorphism is not the same as equivalence and strive to discover peculiar functional equivalence in different cultures.9 This reaction to efforts at reforming African customary law is often accompanied by an almost religious exhalation of the virtues of the traditional system of law.

This was the approach adopted during colonial rule. The second approach is that adopted by new constitutions in the postindependence era, and the third is the approach in the postdemocratization era. This article will describe these three approaches in relation to the status of customary law and their impact on women's rights. In any effort to advance human rights, the courts play a crucial role. Therefore, this article will examine the role of the courts in the implementation of African customary law and the reaction of courts to African customary law norms that discriminate against women. While recognizing the important role legislation can play in law reform, this article argues that the fight for gender equality needs to move to the courts and mass movements. The challenge is how to ensure that courts interpret the law in such a way that gender equality is advanced. This will require social movements to put pressure on the courts and society to act in the interests of gender equality. This suggests",

This will enable us to show that the values used by traditionalists to support customary legal norms that discriminate against women are no longer practiced in their existing form by communities.

The Colonial Period: The Application Of Customary Law  The precolonial law in most African states was essentially customary law in character, having its source in the practices, traditions, and customs of the people. The normative force and legitimacy of customary law is derived from the idea that it is ancient, unchanging and passed on from generation to generation, and that it is part and parcel of people's identity and culture. The colonial administrations recognized customary law and its institutions, although its application was generally restricted to Africans. From its inception the system of administration of justice introduced by the British differentiated between the Europeans and Africans. For example, in Zambia, section 14 of the Royal Charter of Incorporation on October 29, 1889, authorized this differentiation as it entrusted the administration of Rhodesia to the British South African Company.22 It stated, \"In the administration of justice to the said peoples or inhabitants, careful regard shall always be had to the customs and laws of the class or tribe or nation . . . .\"23 Native Courts administered customary law.

Human rights protections did not arise in the colonial period, as colonialism itself was premised on the violation of human rights. The common law and legislation was and still is administered by an English style judicial system. Practice and procedure in these courts has always been in substantial conformity with the law and practice observed in English courts.24 This meant distinct judicial systems with no connecting link at any level of the judicial hierarchy.   At independence many African countries instituted judicial reforms which attempted to deal with two things: (1) integration of the court system and (2) the removal of racial bias in the administration of   justice.25 In most African countries, English or French systems of courts served as models for a full range of African courts: e.g., supreme courts, high courts, and subordinate courts. These courts have the same jurisdiction as similar common law courts elsewhere. At the bottom of these courts, African countries created a fourth tier.

From the inception of colonial rule, customary law was applicable on two conditions: (1) that it was not repugnant to justice, equity, or good morality and (2) that it was neither in its terms nor by necessary implication in conflict with any written law.27 The application of the repugnancy clause has always been a source of controversy. It was observed that subjecting African customary law to a repugnancy clause and the clause being applied to African customary law by English colonial judges meant two things: (1) that customary law was inferior to the common law and (2) that the standard by which the validity of African customary law was to be determined was inevitably to be that set up by English ideas of legal norms, justice, and morality. And yet the values of Western society are embedded in the common law, even as values of traditional African society are embedded in African customary law. These are two different systems of law developed in two different situations under different cultures and in response to different conditions. In addition to the conflict of cultural values, apparent inconsistency in the application of the repugnancy clauses created problems.

Many of today's contentious issues such as polygamy and discriminatory inheritance practices were left untouched. As in other, dual systems of law, there are many problems associated with duality. The coexistence of common law and customary law in the same country raises the problem of when the laws apply and to whom.

It involved all kinds of assumptions and value judgments.\"31 \"In discussing law under the colonial regime, it is usual to contrast the French policy of 'direct rule' with the British policy of 'indirect rule.'\"32 In fact, the two approaches were not different in effect as both relegated customary law to an \"inferior position.\"33 Because the different laws were administered by",

In postindependence constitutions elaborated before the era of democratizations in the 1980s, the independent African states continued to recognize customary law together with the common law and   legislation as a source law. The court system was integrated. This was done by putting the local courts (the courts that dealt with customary law) at the bottom of the judicial structure. Unfortunately, the postcolonial constitutions in this period left much to be desired on the issue of women's rights. The independence and new constitutions of the 1960s contained bills of rights that guaranteed human rights to all on the basis of equality between men and women and, at the same time, immunized customary law against human rights scrutiny.

For example, it has no institutionalized or complicated procedures, and the objective of dispute settlement is reconciliation. This underpins many of its procedures.40 In terms of the future, there is need to create one legal system which takes into account both the received law and the customary law. In a unified system the good values of customary law, such as the simplicity of procedures and the preference for reconciliation rather than litigation, should be reflected in the integrated legal system.

The internal repugnancy clause resides in the judicial discretion to overrule precedents and refuse to follow established common law rules in certain circumstances. As Justice Sutherland stated in *Funk v. United States*, \"the common law is not immutable but flexible, and by its own principles adapts itself to varying conditions.\"137 In outlining a reason for a common law rule, Chief Justice Black in the Pennsylvania case of *McDowell v. Oyer* stated,  [a] palpable mistake, violating justice, reason, and law, must be corrected, no matter by whom it may have been made. There are cases in our books which bear such marks of haste and inattention, that they demand reconsideration. There are some which must be disregarded, because they cannot be reconciled with others.

REFORMING CUSTOMARY LAW: COMPLEMENTING THE WORK OF THE  COURTS  A fundamental question that remains is how do we complement the work of the courts and advance the project of reforming African customary law so that norms that discriminate against women can be eradicated. The task of reform is too large to be left to the courts alone, and courts are handicapped in that they can only deal with issues that arise in cases brought before them. A strategy is needed because opposition to reform by those who benefit most from maintaining the customary system, as well as from political players, should not be underestimated.

This will result in a comprehensive system of norm setting and enforcement mechanism instruments and will lay a foundational framework within which women's rights can be articulated and protected together with other human rights. The second approach is to ensure that human rights instruments are reflected in national constitutions and national legislation. All African national constitutions should outlaw all forms of discrimination and none of them should immunize customary law against human rights provisions.

Reform efforts should start with a comprehensive diagnostic study of each African country's legal system aimed at identifying laws that require reform. Any reform project must begin with the underlying task of figuring out which laws are in conflict with human rights norms of equality and nondiscrimination. With respect to customary law, any reform effort must be mindful of the weapons of the traditionalists who argue that human rights norms are the product of Euro-Christian societies. Reformers must assure the public that the human rights project is not about westernizing African societies, but on the contrary, is an attempt to integrate the traditional and modern values of the African people with the concepts of human rights and dignity for all persons. In order to counter the criticism that human rights is a Western project, the values of the customary law should be studied so that important and nondiscriminatory parts are preserved and included in the legal reform, but without discrimination against women.

In this case, the court held that the customary rule that chieftainship is passed down to the eldest son is out of step with society's new norms that men and women are equal.157 The court concluded that the contemporary practice of the Valoyi community reflected a valid change of custom.158 As Judge Van Der Westhuizen observed, customary law must be permitted to develop.   The legal status of customary law norms cannot depend simply on their having been consistently applied in the past, because that is a test which any new development must necessarily fail. Development implies some departure from past practices. A rule that requires   absolute consistency with past practice before a court will recognise the existence of a customary norm would therefore prevent the recognition of new developments as customary law. This would result in the courts applying laws which communities themselves no longer follow, and would stifle the recognition of the new rules adopted by the communities in response to the changing face of South African society.159 However, it is important, as Judge Ngcobo has observed, \"[w]hen dealing with indigenous law every attempt should be made to avoid the",

It is understandable that there is much nostalgia about African customary law among African people. Customary law is, after all, part of African identity. However, we should not ignore the structural limitations to adapt customary norms to changing circumstances imposed by the nature of the social-economic and political system that existed under colonial rule and contributed to the distortion of customary norms. Africans played a very limited and negligible role in governance and the formulation of laws that governed them. We must also not forget that equality is related to the right to dignity. Following the historical experiences of slavery and colonialism that African people have endured, we should be aware of the fact that discrimination conveys to the person discriminated against that the person is not of equal worth. The discrimination against women conveys the message that women are not equal to men and undermines their dignity.   The fourth approach of the project should be to take the fight for gender equality to mass movements.

This could go a long way in changing the view held by some that the rights project is a western project aimed at spreading western values. We have to ensure that the courts interpret the law in such a way that gender equality is advanced, and social movements should put pressure on the courts and society to act in the interests of gender equality. Courts should be encouraged to examine the prevailing social and cultural conditions as well as the goals of the justice system as they decide cases. They should be encouraged to interrogate customary law and deconstruct it to see what values underpin particular norms.

Customary law, like any other law, is not static and is always changing to reflect how people are living today. This suggests that we need to improve access to courts so that women can bring claims litigating discriminatory practices. This involves not only making courts and legal services accessible and affordable to women, but also should include educating society\u2014men and women\u2014about the Bill of Rights and what rights and obligations flow from the rights articulated in the Bill of Rights. We need to encourage gender-sensitive civic education in our schools and communities. Legal education should target a range of different actors, such as individuals, religious leaders, judges, traditional rulers, and lawyers. It must also involve providing African judges with best practices. We should encourage the exchange of human rights jurisprudence in emerging Africa with the intention of spreading best practices.

However, despite the continuing emphasis on lobola **payments in the ethnographic literature, studies** suggest that 'deviant' types of union are becoming increasingly common, but little is known about their causes (Meekers, 1993).   This is to say there is gradual erosion of normative marriage customs in favor of more informal types of unions. This has been observed in many African societies, especially among the better educated and urban segments of the population (Meekers, 1993). Most theories attribute this decline in the prevalence of formal marriages to the gradual breakdown of the influence of the lineage and to changes in the relative status of men and women that result from socioeconomic transformations. In societies where bride wealth is high, 'there is a tendency to value premarital virginity and males (in particular fathers and brothers) have an interest in controlling the marriage patterns of women' (Obbo, 1980: 51) and consequently bride price is fairly high.

In contemporary Zimbabwe, marriage is understood as a union and bond between two people of the opposite sex.   Heterosexual relations are often prized over homosexual ties for their procreative capacity that often consolidates the bond, not only between couples but also their families. More so, procreation is significant since in the Shona culture one's own being is believed to be immortalized, that is, 'the person does not only live in the present, but in the future' (Gonese, 1999: 20). The legacy bequeathed to the individual by his ancestors is continued after his/her death through procreation. The family name is perpetuated and the link between ancestors and the living is assured. Without children, therefore, the family genealogy and identity ultimately die off. In view of this, a childless marriage is considered a misfortune or a curse from the ancestors or God. This is because procreation is not only a profound function of a marital relationship but guarantees societal regeneration to ensure its continued existence.

Consequently, resentments of the institution of marriage (or of male domination) frequently result not in outright rejection of married life, but rather in a postponement of marriage; for example, until the woman has completed her education or until she has accumulated a certain amount of wealth of her own. Alternatively, some women think it is better to value individualism and consumerism as ways of promoting self independence. As such, they prefer gaining social status and minimize control by parents and husbands by entering into informal forms of unions like cohabitation. These informal marriages are believed to expose both partners to HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases than formal ones like **Kukumbira**.

It is a formal way of asking for a bride/woman's hand in marriage from her parents, **but** with her informed consent**. In the Shona culture,**  kukumbira **is the most legitimate and esteemed traditional** customary marriage system. In this practice, the suitor is invited to the home of the fianc\u00e9e for preliminary introduction. He becomes an authentic suitor if he agrees to marry. Thereafter the process of marriage begins. The boy's parents look for a munyai **(intermediator) (Kileff and** Kileff, 1970: 34) who is usually a neighbor and well respected old man with wisdom and knowledge of the Shona customs.

At least, four main types of marital unions can be identified in Zimbabwe: Traditional customary marriage, religious marriage, civil marriage and mutual consent union/cohabitation. All marriage systems under traditional customary marriage are anchored on the payment of lobola **(bride wealth) by the bridegroom's family to the** bride's family. Traditionally, the Shona considered **lobola** as a noble custom that functioned as a safeguard against marital dissolution because it generally needs to be repaid upon divorce (Bere-Chikara in Meekers, 1993).   The payment of lobola **also gave man custody of the**  children resulting from the union-rights to genetical inheritance (Goody, 1973). Normally, a woman's father would not allow her to take up residence with her partner until these bride wealth payments had started (Bourdillon, 1998: 315). A system based on bride wealth payment implies that the family groups have a vested interest in the marriage and that their influence over the married couple is considerable (Meekers, 1993).

Questions surrounding colonialism and modernity and their meanings weigh heavily on students and scholars who study Africa (Geschiere et al., 2009). This is because becoming modern carries a lot of different meanings and puts concepts of culture and tradition into uneasy use.

This paper using results obtained from both open and closed questionnaire items makes an attempt to provide a new perspective on how a better future might be implemented in Zimbabwe when it comes to issues to do with modernity and valued traditions like **kukumbira**.   Modernity has been differently defined. Hooker (1996)  defines modernity as the sense or the idea that the present is discontinuous with the past, which through a process of social and cultural change (either through improvement, that is, progress, or through decline) life in the present is fundamentally different from life in the past. This sense or idea as a world view contrasts with tradition which is simply 'the sense that the present is continuous with the past, that the present in some way repeats the forms, behavior, and events of the past' (Hooker, 1996).  Hooker's understanding of modernity seem to correspond with some of the contemporary Shonas who think customary practices such as kukumbira **are now**  valueless and a thing of the past. Consequently, there is resentment of the traditional subordination of women to their husbands in the modern Shona society especially among some learned and urbanized women. This is often cited as another reason for the decline in bride wealth marriages. In traditional bride wealth marriages, husbands have authority; husbands expect their wives to be obedient, and they tend to make claims on their wives' labor and income (Obbo, 1980; Bledsoe",

In an attempt to avoid such conflicts a growing group of women now try to escape male control by steering clear from bride wealth marriages (Bledsoe, 1980; MacGaffey, 1988: 172; Obbo, 1980: 44, 153; Oppong, 1980; Stichter and Parpart, 1988; Goody, 1990: 131). It is worth noting that this option of avoiding formal marriage is only open to those women who have sufficient resources outside of marriage such as professionals, better educated, urban, and wealthy women. Rather than contracting a formal marriage, these women prefer unmarried cohabitation or prefer to have lovers who do not live permanently with them because this allows them to maintain their liberty.    It was however revealed by results from both open and closed questionnaire items that while liberty has recently been acknowledged as a necessity to humankind-both man and women, single parenthood always have negative impacts on their children who grow up calling father to all the boyfriends the mother brings home. As one respondent puts it: 'The misconceptions of freedom by some members of our society in the recent past have resulted in the loss of respect for culture and marriage and, as matter of consequence breaks-ups of many families over the years. This has in turn negatively affected the psychology and behavior of children who grow up with single parents instead of both'.   More so, the open questionnaire item revealed that single parents are more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and other such sexually transmitted diseases as compared to those in",

As a matter of consequence, the former have a higher risk of contracting HIV/AIDS than the latter and, (2) Since it is mostly the single parents who have more than one lover, their chances of spreading the disease among themselves are high. This is not to say the respondents were not aware of the fact that even those in formal marriages can contract and spread the disease. The former emphasized the rate at which this occurs among single parents as compared to the rate in those in formal marriages. In the light of these results, we therefore argue that by denying the future generations the opportunity to test the goodness of the customary practice of kukumbira **on grounds that it**  involves payment of lobola, **the current generation is**  jeopardizing the rights of the future generations in the name of social survival and 'cultural freedom'.   It is also the 'cultural freedom' that colonialism and modernity have brought to Africa which results in the tension between modernity and tradition and the socalled crisis of modernity. The latter is the view that modernity is problematic as it replaces traditional ways of life with uncontrollable change and unmanageable alternatives (Smith, 2009).

This proliferation of alternatives is a source of great anxiety and often results in cultural attempts to restrict alternatives in the face of this anxiety. Laying blame and expressing anxiety on modernity, majority of the respondents (43 out 50) affirmed Meekers' (1993)  observation that the gradual erosion of traditional marriage customs (like kukumbira**) in many African**  societies especially among the better educated and urban segment of the population has been a result of the impact of modernity, particularly the unbridled freedom which it embraces. The respondents elaborated that this kind of freedom has made it easier for the contemporary generation to reject their valued traditional customs and create their own sub-culture of values and norms that distorts Africans' identity. Gyekye (1997) shares the same line of thinking. He offers a philosophical interpretation and critical analysis of the African cultural experience in modern times, and notes that in their attempt to evolve ways of life appropriate to our modern world culture; African people face a",

Throughout, Gyekye challenges the notion that modernity for Africa must be equated with Western values and institutions, arguing instead that 'modernity must be forged creatively within the furnace of Africa's many-sided cultural experience' (Gyekye, 1997). Thus Meekers and Gyekye correctly second the Shona traditional perception that modernity or rather cultural assimilation has impacted negatively on Africa as it has weakened family bonds among Africans, and has challenged the shackles of some highly valued traditional customary practices like **kukumbira**.   Besides modernity, it was revealed by results from both open and closed questionnaire items that the daunting of Kukumbira **has been exacerbated by heft bride wealth**  charges, especially in a country like Zimbabwe where economic and political turmoil since the mid 1990s have resulted in high rates of unemployment and acute poverty. The contemporary generation can no longer afford the demands of the customary practice of kukumbira **as Zimbabwe seems to be inescapably swept** up in a downward spiral of socio-economic and political vortex which has extended its tendrils into all facets of life.

Majority (45 out of 50) of the respondents revealed that a woman for whom lobola **has not been**  paid is, according to Shona culture, not a legitimate wife but one of whiling up time with, a kind of toy. This wife has no full dignity even among other women.

It was also pointed out that since the wife ensures the perpetuation of the other family, **lobola**  ought to be paid for her to appreciate her value and contribution. Thus kukumbira **was depicted as a custom**  that shows that the wife is valued and respected by both her parents and her husband. Lobola **was also depicted** as a custom that gives a woman a sense of self worth,  'someone' whose valued services can only be executed upon payment. These findings concur with Gelfand's (1973)",

Lobola paid during the custom of **kukumbira**,  however, is correctly understood as a token paid by the bridegroom or as a form of informing the bride's family that we are now relatives from now onwards.

To my mind African marriages are not short of such ingredients that constitute marriages. Hendrix in a discussion of African marriage systems opines that marriages as we know it, is multifaceted and its definitions reflect this in their diversity. Several normative behavior patterns are counted among its traits in most societies, while ceremonies or transactions commonly mark its inception. In most societies there is an expectation of relative permanence, co residence, a division of labor, sharing of resources, a sexual relationship, procreation and cooperation in child bearing and training (Hendrix, 1996: 173). Ayisi (1997) collaborates this in his work when he also observed that the means by which a man and woman come together to form a union for the purpose of procreation is marriage. He stressed further that African marriages are affected for just this purpose and therefore a childless marriage ceases to be meaningful in this context. For every marriage to be legal, certain requirements have to be fulfilled, and it should be preceded by certain customary observances (Ayisi, 1997:7). However, Megasa adds that \"the communities involved share their very existence in that reality and they become one people, one thing, as African themselves would put it that",

Vol. 1 , No.     A further understanding of marriages amongst Africans suggests that there are at least three defining aspects of these marriages; first marriage is a transfer of legal rights to a woman from her kin to her husband. Not only does the husband gain rights to the wife's labor, sexuality and offspring's, but also the rights to receive compensation for the harm done to her by others. In some societies the husband receives rights to offspring if he pays the full bride price but can receive more limited rights if he makes a small payment. Second marriage modifies and to some degree ruptures, the relations between the bride and her immediate kin. In many societies the wife moves out of her parents' home and they lose a family member. Where the husband joins the wife's parent's household there is less disruption. Third marriage is an affiance, an agreement or contract between two families or groups of kin's, because our African societies see marriage not only as a relationship between two individuals people but also as a structural link between groups (Hendrix, 1998:734).

That is why anything that deliberately goes towards the destruction or obstruction of human life is regarded as wicked and evil. Therefore anybody who under normal conditions refuses to get married is committing a major offense in the eyes of the society and people will be against him. In all African societies everything possible is done to prepare people for marriage and to make them think in terms of marriage (Mbiti, 1969:104).  # Vol. 1 , No.  In some parts of Africa pare choose marriage partners for their children even before they are born. This is to make it absolutely sure that they do get someone to marry. Other parts the choice is made for the young people by their relatives, while another custom is to let the young people themselves find the person they wish to marry and then inform their parents or other relatives. The opportunities for them to do this are provided by social gatherings, dance and communal work and by their knowing other people in the neighborhood (Mbiti, 1969:107).

Another attracting value, which is upheld most in African marriages, is creatively, depicted in kgatla proverb 'a pretty girl either steals or wets her bed'. They mean by this that physical beauty alone is not the most important thing to look for in a wife. Industry in physical work, a respectful demeanor towards elders and a generally good reputation as defined by the ethnic group are the most significant characteristic for both partners. These characteristics are assessed by the qualities of the parent themselves.

In marriage the family is the person's channel of integration into the clan and the wider society.

There are African people among whom rituals are solemnly opened or concluded with actual or symbolic sexual intercourse between husband and wife or other officiating persons. This is like a solemn seal or signature in which sex is used in and as a sacred action, as a 'sacrament' signifying inward spiritual values\"(Mbiti, 1959:146). This suggests that the purpose for sex and its use are clearly stated in African society and it is expected that sex will be limited to this arena. To ensure the sustenance of this 'deified arena' taboo are sounded and expressed out allowed. It does not give room to the situation we are faced with today where sexual licentiousness is promoted and adorned with pride.

So, sexual deviation was indeed a threat to these structures. It became apparent that youth be trained for reproductive life in conformity to the structure through social initiation rites. Sexual morality was safeguarded by the structures of society, more than by individual personal responsibility. Sexual activity was the subject of much ritual symbolism. It was frequently dramatized in dances and arts, and was surrounded by many taboos, a typical example which was avoidance (Shorter, 1999:94).

The traditional values that were associated with marriages attract a lot of attention, for indeed they were meant to protect and preserve the institution. In other words, to educate and inculcate a sense of duty to intending couples while also producing a healthy and conducive society for all. What we are experiencing today shows how the institution of marriage has degenerated because the many challenges it's facing. The challenges values are being jettisoned and corrupted only a healthy reverts to these values will provide a way out for the institution. We would have to take only 'the kernel' from the influx of ideas associated with marriages today from outside and gladly throw away 'the husk'. Indeed our culture and society has a lot for us to learn from and continues to teach us, it is never too late we can regain and restore the institution of marriage.

One of the most prominent is that the birth rate remains in both urban and rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa in spite of the presence of several factors that supposedly promote lowering of fertility (McNicoll 1980). Some of these factors are increased survivorship of children into adulthood, increased availability of education and levels of educational attainment  (for both sexes), increased urbanization, and increased monetarization of the economy via migratory wage labor and cash cropping. Each of these is normally thought to promote the freeing of young people from the control of elders and to foster the development of economically independent nuclear families, close conjugal relations between spouses, and parenting practices with more intense investment in smaller numbers of higher quality children (Caldwell 1977a, 1977b, 1982; Caldwell and Okonjo 1968; Anker et al., eds. 1982; Sudarkasa 1977; Page and Lesthaeghe 1981; see Barkow and Burley [1980] and Vining [1986] for further biosocial consideration of demographic transition.)

There is a common practice in which the rearing of children is shared by many kindred of a child and in which the biological parents are not the primary caretakers of each child. This system is referred to as \"fostering\" or \"borrowing\" or \"lending\" of children. It is best described and probably most clearly institutionalized in West African societies, although reference to long-term lending of children is found in the literature in Central and Southern Africa (Schuster 1979; Mair 1953; Gibson 1958; Harpending, personal communication.)2 The fundamental bonds associated with this family organization are those between a person and his or her consanguineal kin (Fortes 1978). The mother and father, of course, constitute the link between children and their larger kindred, but two things need to be kept in mind: 1) The parents themselves do not expect to be the major providers for each offspring throughout the children's lives, and 2) husbands and wives do not automatically regard their spouses as predictable and long-term sources of support",

Women try to delegate to others the primary care of children while at the same time maintaining a claim on the loyalty and indebtedness of those same children. In order to remain attractive to future sexual partners, women often foster out children froth previous matings (Burley and Symanski 1981, p. 254). These children usually go to kindred of the mother, but they may also go to the father's kin, especially when biological paternity is not in doubt  (Gibson 1958). Indeed, in some parts of Africa it is the rule rather than the exception for children to be reared in a variety of households (often but not necessarily headed by relatives) and to spend only a limited time residing with either or both biological parents. (Bledsoe and Isiugo-Albanihe in press; Isiugo-Abanihe 1985; Goody 1975, 1978; Oppong and Bleek 1982).

The extent and manner in which the actual availability of resources influences perception of resources remains unknown, but the topic will be reconsidered in a later section of the paper in the context of African institutions and their relation to mating and parenting behavior. The term \"resources\" here means goods and services necessary to maintain the individual and his or her offspring and to allow access to mating partners. I am particularly interested in how mating and family relationships become part of the resource base that the individual evaluates in making strategic choices.   Clearly the translation between what an individual's sensory modalities enable him or her to perceive about resources and what he learns about resource availability as a result of experience and influence by other group members is not obvious (Goude 1981; Draper and Harpending 1988).

African men may see no urgency is reducing the numbers of their progeny precisely because a characteristically African set of socioecological circumstances permit many children to survive despite low father contribution to child support.

Objectively, the middle class has access to a subsistence of greater quality, quantity, and predictability than do low-socioeconomic status groups, yet their reproductive performance is quite different. Middle-class parents appear to perceive real scarcity in goods and therefore limit the numbers of their children severely.

Draper and Harpending have argued that such social factors as mother's pair bond status (Draper and Harpending 1982) and the provision of care by parents as opposed to peer caretakers (Draper and Harpending 1987) may be examples of variation in early childhood experience that establish learning tracks with consequences for adult sexual behavior and evaluations of resource availability (see also Lancaster and Lancaster 1987).   Obviously, *cognitions about* resources (a culturally encoded representation)  and the perception of *actual* resources cannot be totally uncoupled, or at least not for long. However, the capability for \"stretch\" between resources and their emic representations is greater than may be imagined, particularly when economic change takes place in the particular social context that, I will argue, is fundamental to many African social systems. With this proviso in mind, it is interesting to approach African social systems keeping in mind that human cultures there have evolved in the context of some rather unique circumstances.3  ## Evolutionary Ecology  Recent studies",

There are no simple correspondences between animal and human models; however, work with nonhuman animals has made intelligible many of the relationships between mating systems, species characteristics, habitat, resource distribution, and the ease with which resources can be stored or defended (Kleiman 1977; Kleiman 1981; Lack 1968; Wittenberger and Tilson 1980; Martin and May 1981). Many of the concepts now used by evolutionary ecologists offer interesting insights when they are applied to human data.   The literature is substantial, only brief examples will be given here.4 All organisms are designed to reproduce themselves, and, in this sense, all functions of an organism are reproductive. Biologists understand that all organisms must make \"decisions\" about how to partition effort, measured in time, energy, or exposure to risk, among the various requirements of growth, maintenance, and re-production. *Reproductive effort* is composed of mating effort and parenting effort  (Kurland and Gaulin 1984).  The key issue in unraveling the associations among these factors is survival of offspring. Among mammals there is a pronounced asymmetry in the reproductive organization of the sexes with high obligate parental investment \"built into\" the female. This is a consequence of internal gestation and dependence of the young on milk supplied only by the mother. Species vary in the extent to which males (who contribute",

For some species, females can rear young without direct provisioning from males, because resources can be harvested by her independently or because pressure from predators can be handled by her alone or by associating with other females in protective herds or burrows. In these situations males may facilitate offspring survival in an indirect manner, as in the case of territorial defense insuring the female and her brood the ability to gather food and or to birth young without intense competition from conspecifics.   The males and females do not form permanent mating relationships, and male reproductive work is channeled primarily into competition with other males for access to females.   In other cases, males come close to females in their allocation of reproductive effort to parenting. In such cases the sexes form durable pair bonds, and the male role in protecting offspring is essential for his fitness. High-male-parental investment will not evolve (or be facultatively expressed) except where benefits to males outweigh costs in terms of foregone mating opportunities. In mammals the extreme sexual inequality in parental investment rewards competition by males for access to multiple mates; for this reason, monogamy is rare in mammals. The infrequent occurrences of monogamy among mammals are \"explained\" on the grounds that under certain conditions of species morphology, characteristics of young, and",

Polygyny can be accounted for in terms of both sex differences in reproductive strategy and characteristics of resource type and distribution. For example, polygyny in birds is associated with both altricial young and habitats such as marsh lands where resources are dense, abundant, and readily harvested by a polygynously mated female who is able to rear her brood without help from the male  (Orians 1969; Partridge and Halliday 1978). Some bird populations will change from predominantly monogamous mating under a stable and restricted resource setting to polygynous mating when resources become abundant. In these circumstances, males compete among themselves for rich territories to which many females will be attracted; females apparently are willing to forego male help in rearing offspring in return for access to good feeding ground via access to the territory of a high-ranking male.   It seems reasonable to assume that polygyny is associated with reduced male parental care in comparison with monogamy for two reasons. First, polygynists, whether extant or aspiring, must spend time and energy besting rival males and in keeping rival males away from females. Second,",

The outcome is the familiar pattern seen in many ungulates, primates, and polygynous birds in which females give comparatively constant individualized attention to young, and males watch primarily other males and those females who are sexually receptive or who show signs of straying.   The perspectives of evolutionary ecology on mating, parenting, and habitat characteristics can be usefully applied to social processes in humans. In the case of humans, of course, simple knowledge of habitat characteristics does not produce much predictive power, since humans remain morphologically quite generalized and \"specialize\" behaviorally in a variety of ways (White 1959; Washburn 1978). For humans, technology is one of the most critical variables that must be included in calculating the relationship between human groups and their local environment (Steward 1955).   On grounds of comparative morphology, humans have been classed as a moderately polygynous species (Harcourt et al. 1981), yet the current trend in large parts of the civilized world is in the direction of increasing the probabilities that most adults will have one primary mating partner at a time.

Human-male-parental investment can vary even more widely than female investment. Particularly under circumstances in which direct male provisioning of mate and offspring is not necessary for offspring survival, theory predicts that male reproductive effort will be directed more toward competition with other males for access to females and less toward parental investment and maintenance of a single pair bond. But it will be shown in this paper that women in African societies have at their disposal a wider range of options for delegating their parental responsibility than do Western women.   From a global perspective, it seems that recent mating patterns in densely settled peasant agricultural systems and in industrial and postindustrial societies have moved toward monogamy together with high biparental investment in diminished numbers of offspring. The strong presumption is that the increased level of competition for increasingly scarce resources among peoples of politically centralized and food-producing cultures has pushed the mating patterns in the direction of increasing monogamy and a pattern of direct male provisioning of their wives and children.

For example, land extensive slash-and-burn horticulture, dependent primarily upon female labor, gives way to labor intensive farming techniques with characteristics that increase the yield of food per unit area, such as irrigation, manuring, oxen-driven plough techniques, and the development of higher-yielding cultigens. Transition to these more intensive techniques of food production includes the movement of men into direct labor in the subsistence sector (Boserup 1970). Women continue to make a subsistence contribution, but it is increasingly in the area of secondary food processing and house-hold management (Ember 1983).   Semantic issues are a significant obstacle to translation of the ideas from evolutionary ecology to the analysis of human social systems. For example, people familiar with the cross-cultural literature on human variability can easily be misled about the actual workings of an institution such as marriage, because the same term, \"marriage,\" is applied to social arrangements that are in fact extremely diverse (Goodenough 1970; Gough 1959). It is true that normative arrangements in known human societies make a provision for 1) the regulation of sexuality, 2) the attribution of paternity, and 3) the rearing of immature young.

In societies constituted in this manner (and they are common in large parts of Africa), wives and children are not salient influences on men. This is a critical and often overlooked distinction in discussion of factors influencing human mating and fertility. When men move in a social universe in which the claims of children are not directly felt (as they are felt by women because of their high obligate parentalism), men's cognitions about the environment and resources necessary for sustenance can differ significantly from those of women.  ## The Institutional Complexes Polygyny  Africa is distinguished by the continued high prevalence of polygynous marriages (Goody 1973). Polygyny is not only the preserve of elite men but is a status to which many men of moderate means aspire at some point in their life span.   (Welch and Glick 1981; Obbo 1980; Arowolo 1981). The persistence of polygyny among rural people can be explained in part by the female farming system, common throughout much of Africa (due perhaps primarily to the availability of land). Much of rural African subsistence is based on the work of women in their gardens; men make only modest contributions. Typically, rights in land are held by men by virtue of their membership in kinship or village units. A man who wishes to add another wife is under few constraints (provided his kinship group",

In rural areas, when a man marries an additional wife, he is awarded additional fields for this woman and her children (Bryson 1981). The importance of male labor to support such households is reduced. In former times, before colonially imposed peace, the male role in defense was important. But since central governments have been present, men who remain in rural villages spend their time in leisure, in management of household labor, or in local political affairs (Potash 1978). More recently, men absent themselves for long periods in migratory labor. They send remittances home that help to pay school and medical fees and to buy clothing. Nevertheless, the work of feeding people remains with women (Hafkin and Bay 1976; Vaughan 1983).  ## Female Farming  The other side of the African polygynous coin is an economic system in which women and children are largely self-supporting. The association of this economic and mating system is not accidental; without certain environmental conditions  (high land availability and low population density) together with the high productivity of female labor, there would be no niche available for the relative \"luxury\" of male competitive mating systems.

Characteristically, men do not return their earnings from cash crops to the household economy. This money is held separately and spent by men on their own projects (Vellenga 1983; Abu 1983; Bryson 1981). Sexual Division of Social and Economic Spheres Separate bookkeeping by husband and wife is the norm throughout much of Africa (Gugler 1972). Men assume that by providing women with access to land (rights in which remain with the man's kin group), paternity for children, and the protection their kin confers on women married in, they have discharged a major portion of their obligations to wives and children. The norms regarding male domestic roles do not emphasize conjugal interdependence nor intimate involvement by fathers in the rearing of children. Polygyny, whether a fact of the domestic arrangement or only a prospect, ensures degrees of distance and formality in the relations between husbands and wives.

Urban women cannot farm, but they find income-producing work as traders, clerks, property managers, prostitutes, and domestics. It appears women realize they cannot expect full support from their mates, and their own values lead them to work for the economic rewards, the autonomy, and the self-esteem that they derive from supporting themselves and their children. Just as values regarding the sexual division of labor have accompanied Africans in their move from rural to urban contexts, so also have values regarding the segregation of the sexes in many spheres of life (Schuster 1979; Harrell-Bond 1976; Little 1965; Nelson 1979, 1981; Little and Price 1967; Oppong 1983; Poewe and Lowell 1980).

It has its roots in an earlier precolonial period when the availability of land, the farming technology, the sexual division of labor, and polygyny enabled a domestic organization for which the men's contribution as husbands and fathers was not essential to the maintenance of women and children. Under such circumstances male reproductive effort was not channeled into parenting (meaning direct provisioning of children) but into mating. At present the social and economic contexts in which people live have changed markedly, yet old values persist; multiple contradictions accumulate both at the level of individual experience and at the level of the functioning of institutions.

Whether older children absorb the major role as child minders while still remaining in the household of the mother, or whether other adults take the children in as wards, the effect is to inhibit the direct access of children to their parents. This opens the way for both men and women to emphasize mating effort (and to raise fertility) and to reduce the time and energy devoted to parenting. Men and women shift the burden differently.   The presence of polygynous marriage and its effect on husband-wife relations has been discussed earlier. An important point about polygyny is that it reinforces the separation of mother-offspring units, both from other like units and from the husband/father. Under polygyny, each wife realizes that the husband does not represent a guaranteed source of support since other co-wives represent competitive claims on his finite resources. This reinforces the notion that the family (from the point of view of the women) is herself and her off-spring. The husband is in a structurally and psychologically distant position.

This is the domestic space in which the man eats, sleeps, receives guests, and spends his leisure time. His wives send food to the husband's hut each evening, where he eats with male relatives and guests.   The emotional distance kept by African husbands is in fact prescribed by custom and justified on the grounds that in order to perform impartially vis-a-vis multiple wives and sets of offspring, the polygynist must maintain an authoritative and aloof distance from close association with any particular wife or child. Otherwise, jealousy would disrupt the household functioning.   The psychological, social, and spatial distance of husbands/fathers, together with their freedom from direct economic responsibility, relieves them of most aspects of the parental role as Westerners understand the term.

The literature on the Nilotic and Niloticized Bantu-speaking tribes of East Africa and Fulani peoples is fairly consistent (Edgerton 1981; Edgerton and Conant 1964).   Domestic arrangements preserve the pattern of sex-segregated social and economic activities, polygyny, and aloof relations between husbands and wives.   The work of tending domestic stock is masculine, but it is not equally distributed among men. The usual pattern is for *young, unmarried* men to move the herds in their transhumant rounds.

Female farming and polygyny combine to relieve men of subsistence responsibility, so that the provisioning of own offspring is not part of what is salient to men. Women shift the burden in somewhat different ways. Like all female mammals, their initial investment (long gestation, risks of child birth, lactation) is high. However, the typical African pattern is to terminate intense care of the child early (by Western standards) in the child's life. Once a child is a year or so old, the mother enlists the help of various surrogate caretakers for her children.

Large numbers of births per woman at relatively short birth inter-vals result (Page and Lesthaeghe 1981).  Earlier it was remarked that African conceptions about parenthood do not include the notion that biological parents are exclusively responsible for the rearing of their children.

African parents (who typically spent much of their childhood in other than their natal households) explain fostering on the grounds that it provides the child with many advantages not available at home such as schooling, occupational training, and the opportunities to live in a more urban area and to acquire modern knowledge. Because children often move in and out of various relatives' homes, they acquire widespread connections and affective ties with diverse kin. These relations may continue to be helpful to the child when he/she is an adult (Goody and Groothues 1977). Elder kin can sometimes override a parent's wishes to keep a child at home (Fortes 1978). They cite their own need and point out that biological parents are more likely to \"spoil\" their own children and not instill proper discipline.   In the context of fostering, parents do not have to reckon carefully the costs represented by each child. Incentives for reducing the numbers of children are quite different than in modern industrialized societies (Oppong and Bleek 1982).   The \"trade in children\" is also related to the system of female farming and the reduced financial accountability between spouses.

Older women prepare for their later years by maintaining ties with their own children and other young relatives. A woman can demand support from her grown children by reminding them of her sacrifices on their behalf in their younger years. She can also relieve her adult children of their own parental burden by taking in her grandchildren, often at quite young ages and rearing them for prolonged periods. Such wards are simultaneously sources of labor to the grandmother in her own agricultural work and justifications for her claims to the parents of the children than she needs money and goods to maintain herself while she rears the children (Bledsoe and Isiugo-Abanihe in press). Young adults will have better educations and have better access to modern resources such as cash, medicine, and factory-produced goods.   Note that these practices are part of a system in which wealth (in some sense)  flows from youngsters to elders, a system characterizing traditional societies that maintain high levels of fertility (Caldwell 1977a,b).

Urbanization elevates the costs of child caretaking, for children must be housed, fed, and clothed in a setting in which all these goods are more expensive (McNicoll 1980). Further, when children are enrolled in formal schooling, they are no longer available for household and agricultural labor.   Although it is logical to assume that, at some point in the course of economic development, parents will feel these logical constraints in their personal lives, the fact of the matter is that the \"pinch\" is not felt particularly acutely, precisely because alternative solutions for the disposition of children remain. The alternatives are ecological as well as social (Gugler 1968, 1972). Although many adults are geographically quite mobile, they retain membership in their rural home villages.   Men in particular keep their options open in the rural social system by the expedient of marrying a wife and installing her in his home village under the supervision of his kin.

This frees the mother to continue her urban occupation, perhaps to advance her training or position without concomitant responsibilities as a parent. From the point of view of the young urban woman the arrangement is desirable. Her sexual relationships with men are less stable than would be likely if she lived in the country. By appearing to be unencumbered by dependent children, she has a better chance of attracting new male partners (Schuster 1979; Oppong and Bleek 1982). This arrangement is also advantageous from the point of view of the rural relatives. The urban mother is a source of valuable cash transfers (on behalf of her fostered children).

In the short run they profit economically and reproductively by the fact that rural (and often older) kin are subsidizing their life style. In the long run, however, the claims that elders can make on the youngsters means that young people find it difficult to amass sufficient savings and property to become economically self-sufficient in the manner of young adults in Western societies. Young Africans continually find that their cash reserves are \"bled off\" either by the expenses of mating competition or by the expenses of surrogate care.6 In other words, economic and social forces that in a Western, middle-class context lead to reduced numbers of more intensively nurtured offspring do not have the same outcome in many African societies.   While delegated care influences parental cognitions of the costs of additional children, it also likely influences the world view of children who are products of this type of rearing. Draper and Harpending (1987) argue that a further consequence of peer rearing and foster care is what children learn at early ages about the nature and location of resources. A child's cognitions about the availability of resources are shaped by the nature of agents with whom he/she must bargain in early childhood. One who is reared in the context of a multiaged peer group and at later ages by adult relatives understands that resources are synonymous with the social milieu to which he/she has access. The",

The point is that this is a complex which maximizes fertility. Young women of primary reproductive potential are freed from a variety of strictures which are known to reduce fertility (Lee 1979; Blurton Jones and Silby 1978; Konner and Worthman 1980). Surplus young who are still immature enough to require protection and support are absorbed by other members of either the mother's or the father's kin group. In this way the heightened risk of mortality young children would otherwise encounter is staved off. This pattern of delegated parental responsibility is made possible by the relatively efficient food producing system that supports moderately dense population and nucleated settlements.

Emic and Etic Assessments An argument can be made that in much of Africa people behave as if they believed resources are abundant. The following discussion lists ecological and economic conditions which underlie many African social systems.   \"Facts\" in Support of an Optimistic View about Resources 1. Africans, as individuals, do not act as if land were in short supply. In many areas the system of land tenure remains one of individual use rights (Bryson 1981). This means that an individual (most typically a man) who can demonstrate group membership, by virtue of descent or common residence, can qualify for gardening land and grazing rights by appealing to local authorities, usually village or lineage elders. In other words, real or de facto private ownership of land is not common. In much of Africa, there has not been the development of a landless proletariat, members of which sell their labor for wages. This is because most Africans, despite ca-reers involving considerable geographical and social mobility, retain membership in a rural home village to which they may return and activate use rights to land and reciprocal obligations based on kinship and village co-residence.  2. The prevailing system of land use does not suggest shortage of arable land. The shifting cultivation system that is practiced in most parts of Africa is notoriously land hungry.

One argument has been that shifting (slash and burn) cultivation is a \"luxury\" that can be afforded only by those not under pressure to improve technology and intensify cultivation. Indeed, it is well known that shifting cultivation produces a high yield per unit labor, though in comparison with more intensive cultivation techniques, it produces a low yield per unit of land (Clark and Hasswell 1966).  3. The freedom of most African men from a primary role in subsistence suggests that severe economic competition within and between groups has not yet been felt.7 Africa is a continent of female farming (Boserup 1970; Bryson 1981).   Over most rural areas, the basic subsistence needs of social groups are met largely  (sometimes entirely) by the work of women. This frees men from primary responsibility for productive labor.  In other parts of the world where population pressure on land has far outstripped that seen in Africa, women do not dominate in primary subsistence production (Boserup 1970). As resources (land, or land-unit productivity) become scarce, human groups have responded with varying techniques of agricultural intensification, such as manuring, irrigation, plough cultivation with the help of draught animals, and consolidation of smaller plots into larger fields. Typically, there are also changes in land tenure from usufruct to private ownership. The general pattern is that male labor becomes important under these conditions.

The main point is that under conditions of intensification (which in all cases result from competition with others), the labor of men becomes essential for the maintenance of women and their offspring. To Westerners this seems to be an unremarkable assertion. We take this arrangement for granted without acknowledging the centuries of technological development, population density, and intraspecific compe-tition that have brought it about.   One would predict that polygynous options will persist for a substantial portion of men in a society only if there are not high requirements for male parental investment. The continued high evaluation by men and in some cases by women of polygynous marriages in many parts of Africa is itself an indication of the extent to which male labor, in the case of primary production and direct provisioning of women and children, is not yet a requirement for subsistence in most African systems (Goody 1973). Continued high fertility in the face of several decades of sharp reductions in infant and child mortality suggest that real economic constraints are not yet felt by many Africans.  ## \"Facts\" In Support Of A Pessimistic View  From geographers, economists, and",

The pessimists recite a lengthy, depressing list of the deficiencies that Africans already face and that accumulate at an alarming rate.  1. The notion that Africa is an under-populated continent is totally mistaken and ignores the fact that rainfall over much of the continent is highly variable. Compared to tropical areas in other parts of the world, the percentage of land that actually realizes an annual high precipitation is small and is itself sparsely populated (Best and de Blij 1977, p. 37). The shifting cultivation system is an adjustment to unpredictable rainfall and not, in and of itself, an indication of plentiful land.  2. Large areas are not arable due to desertic conditions as in the Kalahari Desert or due to heavy tropical forest cover where human densities are low. Tsetse fly infestation covers enormous areas of the continent. Since cattle and most other domestic stock are not disease resistant, husbandry cannot be introduced into such areas, thus effectively reducing the potential for human exploitation. Other diseases such as malaria, schistosomiasis, yellow fever, and encephalitis contribute to human morbidity and low-population densities.  3. The potential for rural people to support themselves by food production is being eclipsed by a high rate of population increase. Growth rates are around 26 per thousand for the continent.

The essentially uncontrolled growth is not accompanied by an increase in food supply or government stimulation of economic expansion, particularly for rural areas that receive less attention than urban areas. World trade patterns further exacerbate this problem. Western nations export subsidized grain, making cash-cropping of subsistence crops uneconomic for Africans.  4. Given the fact that 85% of the African population is rural, the effects of population pressure are most apparent in rural areas. Evidence can be seen in soil degradation as a result of shortened fallow periods, declining crop yields, food shortages, and malnutrition (Best and de Blij 1977, p. 125).   In summary, we have at least two opposed conceptions of how the availability of resources might be perceived. Westerners conclude that disaster is imminent.   Many Africans appear to believe otherwise, if certain of their practices with regard to fertility, parenting, subsistence, etc., are to be taken as indicators. Africans are behaving as if resources are not constrained. Who is right? Or perhaps the better question is, if people perceive resources to be abundant, on what basis do they derive these apprehensions?

Most foraging peoples were easily displaced and absorbed by the intrusive Negroes who were equipped with superior technology (agriculture, animal husbandry, and sometimes knowledge of metallurgy) and more complex forms of social organization, probably featuring unilineal kin groupings and structured political leadership, which gave them an overwhelming edge over the indigenous foragers.   It is likely that a major cause of the failure of contemporary Africans to respond in ways that Western analysts perceive to be rational is that African social systems share a recent historical background of unimpeded expansion into regions well suited for expanding immigrant groups. It would not be surprising to find that many of their social institutions were or are adapted to actual resource abundance.8  ## Conclusion  In this paper several topics have been considered and their interrelationships noted.

However, a trend now worldwide causes most humans to experience increasing competition from other humans and to perceive resource scarcity. In most sectors of the modern, postindustrialized nations, people have responded to the changes by limiting the numbers of offspring and by increasing the levels of parental in-vestment per child. There are countries in the developing world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where many factors associated with increased human competition occur, yet the expected response does not occur. This paper has discussed features of marriage, mating, intergenerational relations, and the sexual division of labor that appear to account for the maintenance among many sub-Saharan peoples of a pattern of high fertility coupled with delegated parental care that relieves biological parents of substantial responsibility for provisioning offspring.   If the hypothesized relationship between reproductive effort and resource availability exists, the question arises as to *what factors shape cognitions about resources* and *how malleable are these cognitions* for individuals who face changing environmental quality.

On the other hand, in a slowly maturing species such as ours for whom the social group constitutes a major component of the resource reservoir, we can expect certain delays in the feedback of information about changes in resource availability. For humans, given the importance of postnatal learning and the dependence of the individual on culturally acquired technology and information, the social milieu becomes difficult to distinguish from \"objective\" assessments of resource availability.   Relation between Resources and Early-sensitive-period Learning One approach to the problem assumes that early-sensitive-period learning is involved in the translation between perception of resources and reproductive effort. Draper and Harpending (1982, 1988) have argued that early learning experiences informed by mother's pair bond status, peer-rearing, and surrogate rearing may lead the individual into a developmental track in which cognitions are formed that critical resources are abundant but accessible through an extended social network. If this hypothesis is correct, one would look for evidence that adult mating and parenting strategies persist in the face of countervailing environmental cues.

The African parents fall back on indigenous institution of child fostering, which is only imperfectly realized in Europe in the form of white, usually working-class families who are willing to take in foster children in return for pay.   As might be expected, the outcome for all concerned does not work in the way it is expected to in West Africa. The foster parents interpret the infrequent visiting of their wards' \"real\" parents as signs of parental neglect and become strongly attached to the foster children. This sometimes results in legal suits for transfer of custody to the foster parents (Ellis 1977). Meanwhile, the African parents make no comparable assumption that the delegation of care means they have surrendered formal rights in children. They consider that by having made safe and reliable arrangements for the care of children and by regular payment of fees, they are dispatching their immediate responsibility.   ## Direct Perception Of Resources  If direct perception of resource availability is crucial, then, in areas of land shortage, fertility should begin to drop. This effect will become apparent most quickly when shortages are felt on a wide regional basis so that parents cannot shift the child-rearing responsibility onto rural kin living in areas of more secure subsistence.

However, as we have seen earlier, the reality with which women deal is not necessarily that of the men. It is likely that a faster change in parenting and mating behavior will come about when men feel directly the influence of mates and offspring.  ## Perception Of Resources: Individual Variability  So far the working assumption has been that the average psychology of all individuals is susceptible to cues from the environment. Discussion has revolved around the proximate mechanisms that transfer raw sensory data into cognitions that are themselves the basis for action. However, it is also likely that there is variability among individuals with respect to the processing of information about environmental quality and the availability of resources. Future research on matters discussed in this paper will need to take account of variability at the level of individual psychology as well as variability in individual life histories.

While it is clear thai there has been enormous progress made in enshrining women's rights, the article urges caution, noting that there are limits to the law 's power to change behaviour. Law cannot always provide a solution to discrimination rooted in socio-economic and cultural dispossession. The article is divided into four parts. Part one introduces the legal systems of the region. Part two offers a discussion of the different constitutional models illustrated by case law relating to inheritance. Part three provides an overview of the African engagement with human rights before moving on to consider the two Declarations of the SADC in dealing with gender-based discrimination and violence against women.2 Part four focuses on the rights contained within the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People 's Rights on the Rights of Women, adopted by the African Union in July 2003.3   ## Introduction To The Legal Systems Of Southern Africa  Common to all SADC countries is a history of colonialism. During the colonial period there were differences in the way that the colonisers chose to deal with the laws of the colonised people. The original British attempt at Direct Rule, had eventually to be abandoned in favour of Indirect Rule, which allowed the 'native populations' limited decision-making powers in the private sphere and, in particular, with",

This included trying to prevent early marriage and the pledging into marriage of girls as well as to facilitate women being awarded custody of children and being allowed to divorce.6 Even with the adoption of a relatively laissez-faire approach to personal laws, difficulties still arose when there were disputes that needed the intervention of colonial courts. Called upon to interpret 'native law' or customary law, the authorities needed to understand the law.   It was not like English or 'European' law in an easily ascertainable form. There were no statutes and precedents did not exist. What were they to make of it?   According to Chanock,7 the perceived gap in knowledge of 'native law' was filled in by a combination of selective presentation of norms by African males who, fearful of losing control over women, presented 'masculinist' constructions thereof.8 There was also the",

For both groups the view of the African woman as entitled to fewer rights was consonant with their patriarchal worldviews. As a result, African women were largely left out of this norm making, leading to the charge that customary law is gendered and excludes the female voice, in much the same way that the feminist analysis of international9 and indeed national law10 claims happens at the national and international level.   Regardless of the colonial experience and the manner of its conclusion, the common theme in all these countries is that postcolonial legal systems are plural. This means that they recognise general law (statute law), usually based on the law of the colonising state,11 customary laws and religious laws including those based on Islamic and Hindu principles.   There is also what is now known as the living law, an informal, flexible 'law' reflecting the day-to-day practices of people, which may differ from the customary law enshrined in statutes or found in court judgements.12 The living law is contrasted with 'state' customary law, which is said to have ossified and not kept up with changes in social behaviour.13 The extent of the official recognition of this defacto pluralism and the arrangement of the legal systems vary. Let us take marriage as an example. Tanzania recognises general, customary and",

South Africa is working towards the formal recognition of Muslim marriage.16 Moreover, in keeping with its constitution, which outlaws discrimination based on sexual orientation,17 the only constitution in the world to do so, South Africa also recognises the right of people in same-sex relationships to marry.18 The countries following a civilian tradition include Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo and they tend to have Family Codes.   Needless to say that whatever the legal system, many people have relationships or unions outside the purview of the law. These are called variously irregular unions, or cohabiting relationships, or relationships in the shadow of the law. The African family structure also lends itself to other types of marital relationships including woman-to-woman marriages in Tanzania and the discredited but still practised levirate or 'inheritance' marriages recognised by the Zimbabwean Customary Marriages Act.19 Although reflecting and acknowledging diversity, plural legal systems have the potential to raise internal conflict of law concerns and to disadvantage women who may be caught in a pincer movement when two or more legal systems collide.20 Other problems raised in post",

Many constitutions use the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 as their starting point.24 Constitutions guarantee civil and political rights. The more recent ones, which include the South African Constitution, also guarantee socio-economic and cultural rights. As already noted, in most states, customary law is seen as part of the national legal system receiving constitutional recognition and protection. The difficulty that arises is in determining what to do when laws within a state are in conflict and in particular what should happen when personal laws violate principles of equality.   Although most constitutional bills of rights include prohibition of gender or sex-based discrimination, not all do. That there is a potential for conflict between some aspects of personal law, and the non-discrimination or equality before the law provisions are recognised in the constitutions of Namibia,25 Malawi26 and South Africa.27 These constitutions make clear that in the event of a conflict, the non-discrimination or equality provisions are there to rank above",

I will now consider, by way of case law on inheritance, how these constitutional models result in women having their rights to property recognised or not.   ## Case Law On Inheritance  In October 2004, the Constitutional Court of South Africa passed a judgment that put beyond all doubt the supremacy of the principles of non-discrimination and equality before the law in relation to customary law.33 The three cases (considered together) all challenged the customary law rule of male primogeniture, which provided that when a person died without leaving a will (intestate), then his/her estate would be inherited by the eldest or closest male relative. The rationale for the primogeniture rule is that although an individual (male) is named as heir, he inherits in a representative capacity. His role is merely to administer the property on behalf of the family or kin group. As women are expected to marry and join the marital family, it is said that they are not suitable guardians for the family property.   The applicants contended that the customary law rule discriminated against African women, violated the equality before the law provision,34 discriminated against (African)  female children in violation of article 28 of the Constitution and was also not in keeping with their human right to dignity as provided for in section 10 of the Constitution.

The right to equality is related to the right to dignity. Discrimination conveys to the person who is discriminated against that the person is not of equal worth. The discrimination against women conveys a message that women are not of equal worth as men.

Neither revolution by top-down change, often without consultation or public education, nor evolution with its fudges, compromises and accommodation of discrimination 'for the meanwhile', seem satisfactory solutions.   Perhaps law is not the answer to what is after all a social/cultural question.51 Armstrong and Sinclair have argued that the focus of the courts on the rights of individuals ignores the fact that African societies are said to be communal. The idea of autonomy or separateness from one's kin groups is therefore alien. The impact of capitalism and the HIV/AIDS crisis in southern Africa, which has decimated families and indeed reconfigured family structure, calls into question the extent to which it can be said African societies remain communal.53 Although the cases discussed above show that there are a few women willing to challenge patriarchal laws and attitudes, this should not blind us to the social and personal cost to the women involved.

Not only does this highlight northern double standards, but it also results in the privileging of the northern perspective or worldview.59 Reinforcing Zvobgo, but from a gender perspective, women in South and Central America have argued that the UDHR would be a radically different document had there been more input from women.60 That Zvobgo's concerns remain current can be seen from the comments made by Evans on the 50th anniversary of the UDHR.61 Evans highlighted the importance of not forgetting the past and also of factoring in global power imbalances in norm making, noting:  Our contention is that any",

There are several reasons for this. The first is that the vast majority of African states have, post independence, voluntarily ratified the international bill of rights. Indeed the ICCPR is ratified by 48 out of 53 African States and the ICESCR by 45. This suggests that there is at least some level of acceptance of the norms contained within these instruments.

However, countering the view that human rights have achieved universal acceptance, is the argument that with human rights, good governance and democracy being seen as preconditions for the receipt of aid, most states now ratify human rights instruments as a means of accessing aid.

This Addendum builds on international developments, not least the UN General Assembly Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Violence Against Women, 1993.85 However, the SADC Addendum goes further than the UN Declaration, adding the concept of economic violence to the existing categories, which include physical, sexual and psychological violence. This addition is an important one in that it recognises that women's economic dependence increases their risk of experiencing violence and also impacts upon their ability to leave difficult marriages.86 Perhaps the most radical development in recent years has been the adoption, in July 2003, by the African Union of the Protocol to the African Charter on the Rights",

Article 17 makes clear that women are to be involved in the determination of cultural practices, presumably so that they will not be discriminatory.107 The Protocol also recognises that 'culture' permeates all institutions from the family through to the state and so provides that the state has an obligation to: 'take all appropriate measures to enhance the participation of women in the formulation of cultural policies at all levels'.108 The preamble to the Protocol makes clear that African values must be based on 'principles of equality, peace, freedom, dignity, justice, solidarity and democracy'. Underpinning the Protocol is the recognition that women have a right to dignity.109 The African Protocol has similar provisions on the inter-linkage of legislative and de facto or social change to those discussed in the SADC Declaration section, providing that:  States' Parties shall commit themselves to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of women and men through public education, information, education and communication strategies, with a view to achieving the elimination of harmful cultural and all other traditional practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes, or on stereotyped roles for women and men.110 This suggests a view of culture as dynamic and constantly evolving. Furthermore, the Protocol attempts to engage",

However, Moser notes that the mere assertion of rights is not enough:  ... while top-down laws and legal frameworks may provide an important normative basis on which to claim rights, in practice, bottom-up mobilization and local advocacy campaigns may be necessary to achieve success in the contestation of claims.116 Manji argues that formal law is of little use to most African women whose lives are far removed from any interaction with the state or norms generated by it.117 She sees the living law or internally generated community norms as having a greater impact on women's lives.118 It may well be, as Maboreke contends that while law grants women rights and legal capacity, it",

It began with an overview of the development of plural legal systems before examining constitutional provisions for addressing issues of discrimination. It then considered case law on inheritance to see the impact of different constitutional models on women's ability to enjoy their rights. Thereafter it looked at human rights on the Continent followed by a consideration of the SADC  Declarations before moving on to consider the provisions of the African Protocol on Women's Rights.   It is clear that there are a multitude of human rights instruments, all of which guarantee the rights of women. However, this normative success has not necessarily resulted in women actually enjoying their rights. There are many reasons for this. States may not be committed to enforcing rights, they may not have the resources to do so, they may be reluctant to face down the resistance that often presents itself when people are confronted with change, or it may well be that states do not see women's rights as a priority. For their part, women may be hampered by a lack of knowledge of their rights, fear invoking them if they do know",

Of a total of 21 chapters, four focus on Ghana. At least another four chapters are written from a South African perspective, and there is a chapter on each of three neighbouring countries, namely Botswana, Lesotho and Namibia. The headings under which the topics unfold in the book, and as listed in the quotation above, are dealt with in six parts. Part One of the book presents a comprehensive and objective discussion, with useful insights, of the nature and future of African customary law. In the first chapter Goodman's 'Survey of Customary Laws in Africa in Search of Lessons for the Future' introduces the relevant topic well, and with a fresh perspective reaffirms the opinion that customary laws in Africa are still relevant in the modern nation-state.

Interactions between modernity, as represented by constitutions, statutes and other 'common laws', and what remains of or has become of traditional African customary law obviously dominate the book. Some chapters also deal with international and regional instruments, especially from a gender perspective. The concluding chapter in Part Six ventures into the academically controversial world of beliefs about the 'ancient past'. The chapter focuses on ancient Egyptian laws and practices which the author (Camara) compares with customary laws in West African countries. As is also evident from its comprehensive index, among the traditional beliefs and (human rights) values discussed in the book are *ubuntu* (which is roughly translated as 'showing one another humanity') and reconciliation, 'indigenous \"reasonable man\" tests' and 'ethnic vicarious liability', various types of female genital mutilation, and magic, witchcraft and cleansing rituals.

The two other contributions on Ghana deal with the following topics: the rule of customary law in the administration of justice and the ascertainment of customary law (Akamba and Tufuor); and, concluding the discussion in Part Three on the role and power of traditional authorities, Abotsi and Galizzi engage in an exciting discussion on the coexistence of traditional leadership and constitutionally established authorities and their roles.

The author, Twinomugisha, presents a contemporary understanding of the relationship between customary law and women's human rights in Uganda. While he challenges the traditional view that women's human rights and customary law are irreconcilable, he is cognisant of the fact that certain customary norms affecting women do not conform to the Constitution of Uganda and therefore qualifies his initial opinion.

Although the author presents some suggestions for reform, these are not however discussed in sufficient detail. Moving away from the land and tenure debate, in the last chapter of Part Four the authors Rautenbach and Du Plessis deal with another important aspect of customary law, namely intestate succession. A lot of attention is given in this chapter to recent South African legislation and case law. Relying on the South African example, the authors provide good examples of how a constitution and the courts can protect and promote customary law.  While Higgins and Fenrich in Chapter Eighteen conclude that the *Recognition of* Customary Marriages Act, 1998 'falls short of providing protections that are sufficiently robust to satisfy constitutional and treaty-based commitments to gender equality', in Chapter Two, at the other extreme, Himonga pleads for 'living customary law' to be 'the major area to which African customary law scholarship should be directed'.

In African communities, marriage is not considered an individual affair that legalises the relationship between a man and a woman. However, it is a group concern because it is not only a union between husband and wife, but one between the family of the husband as well as the wife's family. Marriage in African communities is not reciprocal, i.e. a man and a woman do not marry each other.   Rather, a man marries a woman. On the other hand, marriage bride-wealth given to a woman's family is not a payment, but a gesture to establish an alliance between the two families. In a multicultural society such as South Africa these practices often create communication problems, especially where intermarriage is involved. This paper seeks to highlight competencies in interacting across cultures in a multicultural society with the emphasis on marriage practices.  ## Introduction  The concept 'marriage' is interpreted differently in societies around the world. Generally, marriage can be defined as a legal union between a man and a woman in order to live together and to have children (Allen, 1990:727). Okonkwo (2003:30) defines marriage as \"\u2026 a natural and human reality. By its nature, it is a social fact, a bond that unites man and woman, one that usually leads to a community of parents and children\". Commenting on",

According to Okonkwo (2003), every culture in the world recognises some form of marriage institution and some way of classifying people socially, based on blood relationship and   ## 1  relationship through marriage. Marriage implies customs, obligations and ethical standards among a particular people or culture. African societies differ from many other world societies because they believe more in communal existence than in the autonomy of the individual. The concept of \"marriage\" in the African context suggests a relationship between two kinship groups, rather than a contract between two individuals (Brown & Thakur, 1997). Many parts of the world are becoming multicultural; this in turn leads to intermarriage.  Intermarriage here refers to marriage between members of different racial, social, cultural or religious groups. Intermarriage is becoming the predominant practice in multicultural societies such as South Africa. Since marriage practices differ from one culture to another, people engaging in intermarriage encounter communication problems which in some instances may lead to conflict. For example, some people see marriage as a",

This paper seeks to highlight African marriage practices with the aim of equipping individuals with the necessary knowledge to interact across cultures.  ## Intercultural Communication  Intercultural communication is by definition a process by which communication takes place between people from two or more cultures (Wonkeryor, 1998:4). This involves the concepts necessary to understand people from other cultures and their patterns of communication. Through intercultural communication people from different cultures create shared meanings (Lustig & Koester, 1999:37). Gudykunst and Kim (1992:14) define intercultural communication as a transactional, symbolic process involving the attribution of meaning between people from different cultures. The present age is characterised by increased mobility around the world. With the introduction of modern means of transport, it has become easy for people to reach different destinations for a variety of purposes: employment, seeking better education, or simply travelling for its own sake. Piller (2003:344) writes:  Globalization is characterized by unprecedented numbers of people moving around the world; be it for the purposes of study, employment, pleasure, to flee from persecution, to name but a few. Obviously each instance of international mobility increases the chances for people to meet and find a partner from elsewhere.  A wealth of research in the last three decades has revealed that as",

Gudykunst and Kim (1992:3) state:  The expansion of worldwide communication networks, combined with increases in travel for pleasure or business and international migration of refugees, heightens our awareness of the need for understanding other cultures and their people.  In South Africa, multiracialism was realised with the introduction of a democratic government in 1994. People of different racial and cultural groups were free to communicate and socialise, something that was prohibited before the introduction of democracy. This is in line with Craig- Henderson (2006:49) who states:  When the interracial relationship is believed to result primarily from largescale changes in patterns of interaction between people from different racial groups, external factors are said to have played a role. When barriers to integration are eliminated, and policies ensuring interracial interaction and assimilation of minorities are implemented, relationships that were previously prohibited or circumscribed now become possible.  As a result of increased mobility and the relaxation of the policy of separate development in countries such as South Africa, cross-cultural relationships became possible. Today men and women are involved in intimate interracial relationships and marriage. Couples from different national and/or linguistic backgrounds come into existence. This type of marriage",

People should understand the culture of other societies in order to minimise communication problems. Without adequate knowledge of other communities' cultures, one may fail to understand the meaning of certain concepts and behaviours in other languages. For instance, there are stylistic differences in marriage practices in different societies: in the African understanding, marriage is associated with the elders of the two families, i.e. the family of the man and the family of the woman, whereas in Western cultures, marriage is associated with the individuals, i.e. a man and a woman.  ## Marriage Practices In African Societies  As stated before, African societies do not consider marriage as an individual affair to legalise the relationship between a man and a woman. However, tt is a collective concern because it is not a union between husband and wife only, but a union between two families as well. An African marriage is therefore a contract between two clans and not a direct commitment between the husband and wife. According to Okonkwo (2003:31), marriage in the Igbo tradition is  \u2026 a contract between not only the two persons concerned, but also a matter of general concern for all members of the kin. All the members take it as their natural and cultural duty to find a suitable girl who is to become a member of their household. It is not just",

Both the man and the woman must obtain approval from the entire family. For example, a young man would not personally approach his prospective father-in-law and ask for the daughter's hand in marriage. The young man would instead make his intentions known to the elders in his family, and they would approach the family of the young woman. Weinrich (1983:48) argues that \u2026 [a]lthough young people today try to choose their own spouses, their marriage remains the concern of their respective families and hardly any spouse dares to marry without their families' approval. They may exchange love tokens without informing their elders, but before finalizing their choice, they seek the consent of their families. The families' involvement in a marriage is still one of the strongest factors making for stability.  Mathu (1971:1) bases the definition of marriage on the interpretation of the Gikuyu and explains the concept as follows: Among the Gikuyu customs which constitute their traditional ways of life, marriage is understood as a way of establishing and classifying social relations. It is related to the entire social structure and is part of the relatively stable web of social relations which gives a society its distinctive integration.  Marriage is another way in which an individual shares in group life; it is the basis of the creation of interrelationship between different groups of people.",

This is supported by Okonkwo (2003:32) who states that in African culture, \"to marry\" means to establish continuous relations between the two families. This is so because marriage is firmly rooted in a society where the propagation of life is essentially a communal rather than just an individual concern. As stated earlier, marriage in African societies is not reciprocal, i.e. a man and a woman do not marry each other; a man marries a woman and a woman is married by the man. This means that a man takes a woman. As a result, the man is expected to offer bride-wealth for the woman. The woman in turn leaves her parents and joins the family of the man. She abandons her family name and adopts that of the husband. In contrast, in Western European societies a man and a woman get married to each other, and the families typically play a lesser role. As indicated above, in African societies the man is expected to offer bride-wealth for the woman. Bride-wealth has different names in different societies. Terms such as bride-price, marriage proceeds, dowry, etc. are used to refer to bride-wealth. In South African languages, some of the terms used to denote bride-wealth are *thundu* (Tshiven\u1e13a), *magadi* (Sotho languages) and *ilobolo* (Nguni languages). *Ilobolo* is commonly used by all South Africans to refer to bride-wealth.

It describes a man's obligation to give cattle, horses, hoes, money or other property to the father of his intended bride or wife in consideration of their marriage.\" In the past *ilobolo* was offered in the form of cattle, but more recently both money and cattle may be used to make this compensation. Without the offer of bride-wealth, the marriage between the individuals will not be recognised by both sides, i.e. the family of the woman and that of the man. When the man's family asks for the woman's hand from her family, and the request is accepted, the man will be asked to offer bride-wealth. However, this bride-wealth is not associated with buying something, but is regarded rather as a gesture to establish an alliance between the two families. Hence, in Tshiven\u1e13a it is called *thundu,* meaning *goods.* People who are not aware of this aspect of African culture might interpret this as a form of purchase. In this regard, Monger (2004:40) says:  The bride-price was paid in money, goods or cattle or in labour and was often seen as compensation to the kin group for the loss of the young woman to another group. To the outsider, the payment of bride-price or bride-wealth might appear to be a form of purchase.  The bride-wealth is not a commercial transaction in which a father sells his daughter to another man. This confirms that it is not payment. The father does not expect to make a profit out of his daughters. Instead, this bride-wealth is associated with a marriage agreement between",

It should not be misinterpreted as a purchase. Okonkwo (2003:56) states:  The habit of presenting a gift by the prospective husband to the bride's family is done throughout Africa, though in varying degrees. This marriage gift is an important institution in African societies. It is a token of gratitude from the bridegroom's people to those of the bride, for their care over her and for allowing her to become his wife. \u2026 This surely is not a form of 'payment' as outsiders have so often mistakenly said.  As stated earlier, without the gift of bride-wealth no relations will be recognised by either family.   Kyewalyanga (1978:51) supports the above assertion:  It is the payment of the bride-price which makes marriage valid in most African cultures. The bride-price seals the marriage contract. It acts as a guarantee of the stability of the marriage. The bride-price is compensation to the girl's parents for the loss of a daughter who has been an assisting person in the family. It must be emphasized that though the bride-price seems to imply the buying of a wife, it is neither a buying nor is it intended to mean this. A wife, after the payment of the bride-price, does not become a husband's property.  The husband's power in relation to his wife is not that which buyers acquire over the goods they buy. According to Simons (1968:88), the husband \u2026 does not 'own' his wife in any sense. He",

He is legally obliged to maintain her and fulfill the other duties that a husband owes to his wife. He is liable to lose her and forfeit his claim to a return of lobolo if he ill-treats or neglects her.  The bride-wealth does not have an exchange value. Another important function of bride-wealth is to sanction the control of the groom's family over the couple's offspring. Thus, children born to the woman will be recognised as legitimate offspring. The relative importance of children, in turn, influences bride-wealth gifts because bride-wealth is mainly offered to legalise the affiliation of children (Weinrich, 1983:38). When bride-wealth is given, children born out of such a marriage belong to the husband; but if not paid, children are not recognised as his. For example, when a man separates from his wife without having paid the bride-wealth in African societies, the elders will rule that the wife be given custody of the offspring. The children belong to the family of the wife in this regard. However, if the bride-wealth has been paid for the woman, custody of the offspring will be given to the husband and his family. Mathu (1971:2) states: \"The right of ownership and control over the socialization of the offspring on the part of the husband is established by means of 'bride-token'  (*ruracio*), which is given to the bride's kinsmen by the groom himself, or the",

Cutrufeli (1983:49) supports the above: Marriage goods are not for exchange; actually, by being moved one way or another, they sanction the control of one side over the offspring of a woman from the other side. It is not a matter of exchanging women for dowry items: what is the issue in this circulating process is the offspring anticipated from a woman. It would probably be more accurate to say that dowries circulate not contrariwise to women but to children. Truly, it can be observed that in case of divorce often the dowry is not rendered if the children stay with their father.  The right of ownership of the offspring is practiced differently in other cultural groups. The offspring belong to both husband and wife because the offering of bride-wealth is not recognised.  ## Conclusion  Knowledge of African culture regarding marriage practices is of utmost importance to those who wish to involve themselves in intermarriage with Africans. This will minimise any misunderstandings, such as who should be major players in the marriage (families or individuals),  the gift of bride-wealth, and ownership of offspring in case of separation or divorce; which might result in conflict. Marriage in African societies means something different to other cultures in the sense that it is communal rather than individualistic. A woman is married to the family of the man, whereas the man becomes the son-in-law to the family of the woman. The value of the involvement of the two families in the marriage",

In many instances, the two families will try to reconcile the two individuals. Under no circumstances will they encourage divorce. According to Nwosu (1999), divorce is not common where this practice is still followed. Marriage is therefore conducted to form strong relationships between two kinship groups. The payment of the bride-wealth is highly regarded in African societies because it legalises the marriage. The bride-wealth paid by the man is not meant to buy the woman, but is a token of appreciation to the parents of the woman, and legalises the affiliation of the offspring. Without bride-wealth there is no marriage in African societies.  ## References  Allen, R.E. (ed.). 1990. *The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English.* Oxford: Clarendon Press.

One of the most prominent is that the birth rate remains in both urban and rural areas of sub-Saharan Africa in spite of the presence of several factors that supposedly promote lowering of fertility (McNicoll 1980). Some of these factors are increased survivorship of children into adulthood, increased availability of education and levels of educational attainment (for both sexes), increased urbanization, and increased monetarization of the economy via migratory wage labor and cash cropping. Each of these is normally thought to promote the freeing of young people from the control of elders and to foster the development of economically independent nuclear families, close conjugal relations between spouses, and parenting practices with more intense investment in smaller numbers of higher quality children (Caldwell 1977a, 1977b, 1982; Caldwell and Okonjo 1968; Anker et al., eds. 1982; Sudarkasa 1977; Page and Lesthaeghe 1981; see Barkow and Burley [ 19801 and Vining [1986] for further biosocial consideration of demographic transition.)
